  "regular-body": "<p>\n\nOkay. So as arbitrary as it seems, by a number of conventions in my rp days I’ve I ended up with a bit of an oddly specific headcanon: that Mituna has stomach problems. As in, intermittent cramps that won&rsquo;t go away no matter what you do until they dissipate on their own, Relentless Pickiness and Only Eats Like Five Things Ever, etc.  This actually came from a number of things:<\/p><!-- more --><p>The first of which being that I keep running into Kankris that headcanon he has problems with his wrists. I&rsquo;ve seen if a few times, from different people, with varying severity and origin (from them being really sensitive to literally burning and scarred; from just always having been that way to being directly tied to his role as Seer of Blood). It&rsquo;s fairly obvious it comes from the execution of the Sufferer and his canon visions of Kankri&rsquo;s life. They use this to strengthen the bond between them between his lifetimes, which is pretty freaking cool.  So, considering the fanon (I seriously though it was solid fact, but can&rsquo;t actually find textual mention of it anywhere in canon; I’m still gonna ship it, though) moiraillegence between The Signless and The Psiioniic, I threw in a little parallel. I maaaay have been influenced because I really love h\/c. May. You can prove nothing. <\/p><figure data-orig-width=\"277\" data-orig-height=\"294\"><img src=\"https:\/\/64.media.tumblr.com\/9ae9be39f41bc69044242d8185376e3e\/tumblr_inline_nuaisikCiC1trzovr_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"277\" data-orig-height=\"294\"\/><\/figure><p>Hey, a handy chart! According to this (and numerous other Google Images searches) Gemini rules over the arms\/hands, and Cancer over the stomach. <br\/>Of course, that&rsquo;s super flimsy and hardly justification. Which is why on to point two:<br\/><br\/>In my headcanons, pre-incident (and by extension post-incident) Mituna is Pretty Damn Autistic. I&rsquo;m going to go based off of what my mom told me after having taken my sister to Occupational Therapy for three years, because all the google results I can see come from A. The Evilest Evil (autismspeaks) or B. really ableist-sounding sources; a lot of diagnosed autistics have stomach issues, like Chron&rsquo;s disease and such or just digestive problems in general (though it&rsquo;s not a direct correlation and 100% of the time thing, and as with everything severity differs). Also in this category come sensory issues, which make some foods seem intolerable because of smell\/taste\/texture and what not. Combined with a penchant for familiarity, it falls into a habit of basically eating thee same things all the time (I don&rsquo;t need a source on this one, really, because I brought the same thing to lunch every day all my Freshman year; it&rsquo;s a routine thing I know from experience). All in all it&rsquo;s just sort of a neat little nod, even if it&rsquo;s also partially because of xenobiology. <\/p><p><br\/>Xenobiology, I presume you say because it makes for a good segway? Xenobiology, I reiterate, pretending all of the stuff I wrote into <a href=\"http:\/\/ceruleantrafficlights.tumblr.com\/post\/71804964862\/this-is-silly-and-probably-off-in-some-ways-but\">my old, outdated psion&rsquo;s anatomy post like two years ago<\/a> holds any merit on its own, pointing to an electric eel.<\/p><figure data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"452\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.evernote.com\/shard\/s304\/res\/1a0ab1f3-36d6-4b79-b749-3216a98fecbe.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"452\"\/><\/figure><p><br\/><\/p><p>Wow. That sure is an eel. <\/p><p><br\/>Essentially, the electricity-making part and the electricity-dictating part are in different parts of the body; as a psion rather than an eel, Mituna&rsquo;s electric organ would be somewhere semi-nebulous under his stomach, for optimal powering-up-in-a-big-enough-space-without-squishing-anything-too-vital-aside and actually-making-and-processing-battery-fuel capabilities. As a powerful psion, it gets a little trickier. He generates more power than his brain knows what to do with, so some of it just discharges to get rid of the excess&hellip;. which charges into his stomach. Which makes it cramp. Painfully, awkwardly, and inconveniently.<br\/>Finally, we have the (vague) connection to Charon&rsquo;s obol. Charon&rsquo;s obol was, in effect, a coin formed out of precious metal that was buried with the deceased as fare for the ferry across the River Styx and into the afterlife in ancient Greece. The coin wasn&rsquo;t only buried alongside the body, however. As can be seen in archaeological photos, and in classical art depicting Greek lore&hellip;.  <br\/><\/p><figure data-orig-width=\"803\" data-orig-height=\"562\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/64.media.tumblr.com\/7ae9aa4b87143559574ba4a5769cca71\/tumblr_inline_nuaiygcGkD1trzovr_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"803\" data-orig-height=\"562\"\/><\/figure><p>\n\n&hellip;. they put the coin in the cadaver&rsquo;s mouth before burial. <br\/>It&rsquo;s not explicitly having to do with the stomach, but <a href=\"http:\/\/xenobioluminescence.tumblr.com\/post\/128542274621\/charons-obol-the-choice-of-the-heir-of-doom\">the big thematic connection between Charon&rsquo;s toll and Mituna<\/a> serves to make an additional association more potent.<\/p><p><br\/>So yeah. Mituna has stomach problems. That&rsquo;s a thing in my headcanon ‘verse.\n\n<br\/><\/p>",
