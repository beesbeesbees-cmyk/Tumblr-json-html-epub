And then used that to castigate and demean not only the people who actually take their limited time to create gorgeous art but also to denigrate modern day worshippers of Persephone and Hades?<br\/><\/p><p>Maybe next time, you stringy piece of over-boiled okra, you might want to take your own advice and pick up a book, instead of reducing the feared and respected Queen of the Underworld who held power equal to or in many interpretations GREATER than her husband into a meaningless pastiche of female disenfranchisement that you seemingly plucked from your own ass.<\/p><\/blockquote><p>JESUS CHRIST THANK YOU<\/p><\/blockquote><div>I don’t often reblog posts of people getting owned, but when I do…<\/div><\/blockquote><p>man the ancient greeks didn’t dare to speak persephone’s <i>name<\/i> she was that powerful and venerated (they called her <i>Kore, <\/i>“the maiden”), hades didn’t get that honour<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Okay, I actually went ahead and <i>read<\/i> the the source material.<\/p><p>The bulk of it focuses primarily on what Demeter’s up to, not what Persephone and Hades are doing, and what we do get in the subject is really interesting- after Demeter’s strike against the harvest goes on long enough that even Zeus is like “whoa, no, something needs to be done about this,” Hermes is sent to Hades to tell him what’s up and ask him to release Persephone to her mother in the world above.<\/p><p>This is what follows:<\/p><blockquote><div>Hadês, King of the Dead, smiled<br\/>            with his brows, and he did not disobey the order of Zeus the King.<br\/>            Swiftly he gave an order to bright-minded Persephone.<br\/>360       “Go, Persephone, to your mother, the one with the dark robe.<br\/>            Have a kindly disposition and <i>thûmos<\/i> in your breast.<br\/>            Do not be too upset, excessively so.<br\/>            I will not be an unseemly husband to you, in the company of the immortals.<br\/>            I am the brother of Zeus the Father. If you are here,<br\/>365       you will be queen of everything that lives and moves about,<br\/>            and you will have the greatest <i>tîmai<\/i> in the company of the immortals.<br\/>            Those who violate <i>dikê<b>–<\/b><\/i> will get punishment for all days to come<br\/>            —those who do not supplicate your <i>menos<\/i> with sacrifice,<br\/>            performing the rituals in a reverent way, executing perfectly the offerings that are due.”<br\/>370       So he spoke. And high-minded Persephone rejoiced.<br\/>            Swiftly she set out, with joy. But he [Hadês]<br\/>            gave her, stealthily, the honey-sweet berry of the pomegranate to eat,<br\/>            peering around him. He did not want her to stay for all time<br\/>            over there, at the side of her honorable mother, the one with the dark robe.<\/div><\/blockquote><p><i>Well<\/i> then.<\/p><p>So Hades actually tells Persephone that he has no intention of being a douchebag husband to her, and right off the bat, the original canon of this story has him giving her the pomegranate seeds specifically because he’s afraid he’ll never see her again if he doesn’t.<br\/><\/p><p>Fair, on both accounts. I wouldn’t blame her for running away! Being sucked down into the earth and kidnapped by a complete stranger in <i>a golden chariot drawn by immortal horses<\/i> in the middle of cheerfully picking flowers with your friends on a sunny afternoon sounds just as genuinely terrifying as it does terrifyingly badass.<\/p><p>On the other hand, it seems to be suggested here that Hades might be infatuated with Persephone- she’s repeatedly stated to be incredibly gorgeous and bright, an interesting contrast to the descriptions of both Hades and his realm as dark and misty, and the fact that Hades would’ve actually had to have <i>asked<\/i> Zeus for his permission gets kind of interesting once you realize that it seems a lot like Hades does not leave the underworld basically <i>ever<\/i>.<\/p><p>He just hangs out there with pretty much just dead folks for company. Sounds a little lonely.<\/p><p>Now, Hades isn’t malevolent or discontent with his lot as lord of the dead (two of the many inaccuracies taught to us by Disney’s <i>Hercules<\/i>) but he <i>is<\/i> canonically really anal about not letting people mince in and out of the underworld willy-nilly- it’s a <i>thing<\/i> with him. You come in to stay. That’s how death works. That’s the point.<\/p><p>But Demeter’s really upset and, y’know, a lot of that probably has to do with the fact that she’s associated with the harvest (strong ties to the earth) and Hades is associated with the afterlife (strong ties to the underworld), so it might not actually be possible for her to pursue her daughter where she’s been taken. Fair enough.<\/p><p>Here’s the thing, though: when Hermes comes to find Hades, he’s apparently sitting with Persephone on a “funeral couch” while she cries about missing her mom. <\/p><p>This statement immediately precedes a confusingly ambiguous line about her crying about “the unbearable things inflicted on her by the will of the blessed ones,” but the associated note actually says that the text here is garbled, and this line is “an approximation” of what the original would’ve said. This is also the only real implication given that Persephone is being <i>mistreated<\/i> by Hades, and the plural used here (”the blessed <i>ones”<\/i>) seems to indicate it’s actually a reassertion of the same sentiment given to us in some earlier lines about how she’s crying and calling out for help because she misses her mother and her friends and she’s afraid she’ll never see anyone she loves again:<\/p><blockquote><div> She was being taken, against her will, at the behest of Zeus,<br\/>            by her father’s brother, the one who makes many <i>sêmata<\/i>, the one who receives many guests,<br\/>            the son of Kronos, the one with many names. On the chariot drawn by immortal horses.<br\/>            So long as the earth and the star-filled sky<br\/>            were still within the goddess’s [Persephone’s] view, as also the fish-swarming sea [<i>pontos<\/i>], with its strong currents,<br\/>35         as also the rays of the sun, she still had hope that she would yet see<br\/>            her dear mother and that special group, the immortal gods.<br\/>            For that long a time her great <i>noos<\/i> was soothed by hope, distressed as she was.<br\/>            The peaks of mountains resounded, as did the depths of the sea [<i>pontos<\/i>],<br\/>            with her immortal voice. And the Lady Mother [Demeter] heard her.<\/div><\/blockquote><p>So she’s probably crying because her father’s a jackass who thought it would be a good idea to tell Hades it would be cool to rip her away from everything she’s ever known. I’d be pretty upset, too.<\/p><p>Unless you want to quibble about “being taken” as potentially euphemistic, which I sincerely doubt considering the frankness of the translation otherwise, their side of the story goes like this:<\/p><p>Hades kidnaps Persephone, brings her to his domain, and then… quietly sits beside her while she cries ceaselessly about missing home, apparently just patiently waiting for her to calm down enough to consider being <b><i>a badass goddess of the undead?<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>And in the end, he settles for sharing her with her mom so she can see her friends and family part of the time and be <i><b>a badass goddess of the undead<\/b><\/i> the other part of the time.<\/p><p>Unless I’ve seriously missed something, honestly, the most objectionable part of all of this might actually be that he’s <i>her uncle<\/i>. Gross.<\/p><p>(And that’s not even all that weird for Greek mythology.)<\/p><\/blockquote>",
