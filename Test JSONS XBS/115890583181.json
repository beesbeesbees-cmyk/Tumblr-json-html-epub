Lapis fusion in “Jail Break,” we now know that consent is a prerequisite for fusion—a gem can’t force an unwilling gem to fuse with them. but even aside from that—and Connie &amp; Steven’s and Ruby &amp; Sapphire’s spontaneous joy-, comfort-, and intimacy-based fusions aside—one of the aspects of gem fusion that caught my attention was its etiquette…or more accurately the etiquette the crystal gems abide by when they’re fusing.<\/p><p>both of the times that we’ve seen Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl fuse with one another to form Opal and Sugilite, they bow to one another before attempting to synchronize…<\/p><figure data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https:\/\/64.media.tumblr.com\/ef174288e959a70460a49d56699f8238\/tumblr_inline_nlmrvktTot1qiuh5y.gif\"\/><\/figure><figure data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https:\/\/64.media.tumblr.com\/7605cf2e8db1c265af27d2c9beffbf1f\/tumblr_inline_nlmrw8c0L21qiuh5y.gif\"\/><\/figure><p>…which is a clever detail that simultaneously acknowledges the performative aspect of fusion—dancing for each other and the gem they’ll become together, even more so if the music we hear as they synchronize are the sounds their gems make as they harmonize in-universe (I’d like to think it is)—and counts as a gesture and demonstration of their intent, consent, and respect for one another. <\/p><p>the bow is even included first in Pearl’s sand model of the way she and Amethyst form Opal, which is not only cool but—based on Pearl’s fastidious nature—gives us a pretty good indication that the bow is integral to the crystal gems’ fusion process.<\/p><figure data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https:\/\/64.media.tumblr.com\/4449e0793cc1f048bb065bdf2b857b07\/tumblr_inline_nlmux8jXQ21qiuh5y.gif\"\/><\/figure><p>immediately after they bow, their gems begin to glow, almost as if they’re resonating with each other.<\/p><figure data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https:\/\/64.media.tumblr.com\/47d433c20692e25e979534a3250aa0a2\/tumblr_inline_nlmsy6xR7r1qiuh5y.gif\"\/><\/figure><p>it’s also really important to note that Garnet’s, Amethyst’s, and Pearl’s dances are unique to them as individuals and fit their personalities. <\/p><p>so far Amethyst is the only gem we’ve seen fuse with more than one gem, but based on what we know about her fusions with Pearl and Garnet and all three of their dance lessons to Steven in “Alone Together,” we can also tentatively extrapolate that how exactly they dance\/synchronize varies and is unique to the gem they’re fusing with: Amethyst doesn’t dance with Garnet the same way she dances with Pearl, Pearl doesn’t dance with Amethyst the same way she dances with Garnet, Garnet doesn’t dance with Pearl the same way she dances with Amethyst, the ways each of them danced with Rose were distinct, the ways each of them will dance with Steven will be distinct, and so on.<\/p><p><b>Amethyst &amp;

Jasper doesn’t dance so much as control and physically manipulate Lapis’s movements; before Lapis seizes control of Malachite’s water abilities to imprison them, in fact, it would seem that Jasper is in complete control. to be fair, Jasper probably thought that she was, and Lapis wanted her to think that she was. that said, it’s a very utilitarian process. “Malachite” is not presented as her own individual gem like Opal, Sugilite, and Garnet are, because Lapis and Jasper are quite literally two separate beings at war in the same body. in this vein, Lapis isn’t a partner so much as a tool or accessory Jasper has picked up to grow strong enough to finish off the crystal gems. there’s obviously no mutual respect between them whatsoever, nor is there a true representation of who these two gems are. they are not synchronized at all. like Garnet says, they truly are bad for one another—and Malachite’s monstrous form is a reflection of their animosity toward one another, Jasper’s overall attitude and approach to fusion, Lapis’s ulterior motives, and the manner in which they performed their synchronization.<\/p><p>we can’t really use Jasper and Lapis’s fusion to make generalizations about Homeworld with certainty, but at this point in time this fusion is all we have to go by. at this point though, I think this impression of Homeworld gems is best used to contrast and heighten our knowledge of the crystal gems.<\/p><p>despite their interpersonal difficulties, all five of the crystal gems we’ve met have fundamentally loving relationships with one another—and I believe the strength and “normal physical appearances” of their fusions relative to Malachite can be attributed to that love. the crystal gems are a family, and that love and attachment that seems so peculiar to the Homeworld gems can be traced back to Rose Quartz.<\/p><p>Rose loved and saw the beauty in all living things. her love for and desire to protect Earth and all its life was a large part of what motivated her to start and lead the Crystal Gem Rebellion, but—given Jasper’s comments about and disdain for Ruby, Sapphire, Amethyst, and Pearl—it also seems that she loved and saw the beauty even in gems deemed “defective” or “weak” by Homeworld. Rose didn’t love Pearl, Amethyst, Ruby, and Sapphire in spite of their “defectiveness” and faults, but because of them, as inextricable parts of these gems that she loved. it’s all too likely that it was Rose’s love for other gems regardless of their so-called defectiveness that earned the loyalty of her army. at the very least, we can be certain that Rose’s love was what earned Pearl’s, Amethyst’s, and Garnet’s loyalty and love, and what encouraged them to love one another as well.<\/p><p>what Rose stood for was revolutionary in the sense that accepting and loving gems (and <i>all<\/i> living things, even the native life on a planet that would eventually be destroyed by Kindergarten) because of their faults, individuality, and defectiveness challenged what seems to be the very foundation of the Homeworld gems’ empire and society…and right now one of the biggest, lasting effects of Rose’s revolutionary love is the crystal gems’ approach to and the strength of their fusions. for the crystal gems, fusion isn’t just a means to an end. it’s serious magic they only use in emergencies, and you can certainly compare that to Jasper resorting to fusion once Garnet had defeated her and she finds herself stranded and outnumbered on Earth, but the distinctions in approach make all the difference. <\/p><p>“Giant Woman” illustrated this perfectly. Amethyst and Pearl’s relationship is strained because their personalities clash a lot. Amethyst’s impulsive and fun-loving nature often alarm, concern, and irritate Pearl; Pearl’s fastidious and serious nature often annoy, smother, and remind Amethyst of the things she most dislikes about herself, like the circumstances that led to her being made. unlike Sugilite, Opal is very prone to defusing because Amethyst and Pearl have such different personalities—but Opal is as powerful as she is because, despite it all, Amethyst and Pearl genuinely love and care for one another. in “Giant Woman” they had trouble forming Opal because Pearl was put off by Amethyst’s dancing and how “erratic” and “formless” it is—an unfiltered expression of her personality—compared to hers, but once Steven was in danger, they were quickly able to overcome and accept one another’s perceived faults and fuse to save the kid they both love…which they did very nearly effortlessly. Opal—their open and honest conversation, beneath all the pretenses—is powerful because their relationship and love for one another and shared loved ones are strong.<\/p><p>everything about the crystal gems’ fusions…the individual and varied approaches to synchronization…their respect for one another and the gem they will become together communicated by the bowing…the strong resonance their gems experience when they synchronize—the harmonious agreement of their associated sounds\/instruments in “Amalgam” and “Synchronize,” and the way their gems glow in recognition of one another—all of the crystal gems’ (revolutionary) fusion etiquette, and the fact that they have even agreed and taken the time to come up with this etiquette in the first place, stem from their love for one another, the love that Rose fostered and encouraged in all of them…and <i>that<\/i> is what distinguishes the crystal gems from the Homeworld gems we’ve met so far. and—gosh, conveying that distinction through fusion is such an excellent, inventive way to do it…!<\/p><\/blockquote>",
