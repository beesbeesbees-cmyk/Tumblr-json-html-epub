  "regular-body": "<p><a href=\"http:\/\/pastastrology.tumblr.com\/post\/121559155558\/the-signs-as-fictitious-ancient-societies\" class=\"tumblr_blog\">pastastrology<\/a>:<\/p><blockquote><p><b>Aries:<\/b> Located extremely close to the equator and bordering several active volcanoes, Arian people are known for their advanced warfare techniques and exuberance in the destruction of their foes. This does not mean, however, that they don’t have an innate softness. They have a very equal society and the fruits of war are always distributed evenly throughout the kingdom. Competition is a dominant element, but not without generosity or passion. Their people value honesty and fierceness, and have the uncanny quality of almost looking lit from within. Each citizen is fiercely independent, but this does not inhibit their ability to create long lasting allies of foreign nations. They tend to have bright teeth and a strong stature.<\/p><p><b>Taurus:<\/b> Taureans inhabit the deepest, most fertile, forests. They have never seen the fury of violent dry spells or harsh rains, and therefore believe in extremely benevolent Gods. Their homes are in painstakingly crafted underground burrows and hollow tree trunks. Known for their extensive botanical knowledge and musical proficiency, they attract a worldwide market of merchants and tourists, despite their own roots being solidly planted on their own sacred land. Their kingdom values tranquility; meaning its citizens learn from a young age the art of centering one’s being in a craft or wholesome thought. These people tend to have pensive expressions and soft, deep voices, good for singing or public speaking.<\/p><p><b>Gemini:<\/b> Known universally as ‘bird-people,’ these airy treetop natives live in drier, more unpredictable climates, suffering both extreme heat and extreme cold, extreme drought and endless persistent rains. Despite these drawbacks, Geminians <i>prefer<\/i> to live in constant discomfort, as it broadens their mind. Diligent explorers, and full of curiosity, they search the planet in hopes of returning information about each of the twelve vastly different cultures. Recognized for their high quality literature and versatility in battle, they are a powerful nation. Extremely agile, Geminian society prizes those who can hold an interesting conversation the longest, and each citizen has a mastery of at least three different languages.<\/p><p><b>Cancer:<\/b> Resting placidly on the shores of a river basin, the kingdom of Cancer is solid, beautiful, and halfway underwater. Constructed with sea glass and stone, the city can be seen from miles away, glimmering peach and gold in the mid-day sun. On the surface, a well fortified network of close knit communities welcome travelers and refugees of all nationalities. But underwater lies an expansive, well-catalogued, library, with volumes of every type of book imaginable. It is typical for a Cancerian family to be close and, even, for several Cancerian families to live in one big happy commune. Known for their innate ability to heal, their medicines are often the most costly and effective on the market.<\/p><p><b>Leo:<\/b> Leonine territory is settled deep in the fertile valleys of a redwood forest, its terrain cresting and falling in hills on which they can look out and observe their impressive kingdom. Living in a hot, fertile, climate, they attract many a suitable ally, and usually they accept. They are a monarchy- of course, and their ruling royal family is everything one should be; kind, valiant, and, most importantly, <i>proud<\/i>. Even Leo abodes reflect their power and pride- built into the very redwoods that shield them and provide for them. They value charisma, kindness, benevolence, and passion, and no one could say they do not live up to these expectations. Skilled in the arts and theater, they attract visitors world wide for their annual story telling festivals and raucous celebrations. <\/p><p><b>Virgo:<\/b> Living on mist-blown grassy plains, Virgos are ultimately a society of doing. Their buildings are crafted to withstand the harshest weather or natural disaster, their town streets and parks are manicured to the most minute degree, and their minds hold seemingly endless amounts of intricate information from a very young age. Virgo society holds learning and self-improvement highly, possessing an educational system tailored to the needs of each student’s interests, and lasting long into adulthood. Each Virgo uses their analytical brain to take in every aspect of the world, and holds bordering nations to as high standards as themselves. Despite being an introverted nation, Virgo will not compromise what they see as the truth for another. Well put together, with shrewd, decisive mannerisms, Virgos are easy to spot in a crowd.<\/p><p><b>Libra:<\/b> A society with a strong sense of justice and beauty, Librans reside on the flanks of tropical alpines which protect them from conflict, while also offering well-traveled trade routes. Their empire is visited frequently by leaders of each foreign nation, and draws crowds due to the simple elegance of its towers and streets. Libran people are often regarded as socially adept and physically immaculate, and sometimes it’s difficult for their kindly leaders <i>not<\/i> to make allies. The arts are exceedingly important to Libran society, especially acting, and young Librans attend group art classes up until their late teens. The Libran justice system is, of all the nations, the most fair, and Libran lawyers are highly sought after worldwide. You will never find Libra in a battle with another nation of their own starting, and it’s not rare to find Libra mediating other nation’s quarrels.<\/p><p><b>Scorpio:<\/b> A bustling city quite literally built into the sea with no land to anchor it, it’s not very clear how the Scorpions found their way there at all. These natives tend to be elusive and rather mysterious. Traveling in black houseboats from the mainland to their city and back, they bring with them cryptic ancient books filled with odd symbols and incantations, pearly skulls, and beautiful, but disturbing, art. They are a quietly powerful people, their government is run by an anonymous group of diverse citizens representing each district. The center of the Scorpionic religion lies in sex and death, cultivating an intense fixation on both ends and beginnings. Their God requires sacrifice, emotional turmoil, and endless devotion through their universally renowned dances. <\/p><p><b>Sagittarius:<\/b> Residing in a triangle of hot tropical islands, the nation of Sagittarius was originally a nomadic tribe that grew to such proportions that it was forced to finally settle. Although their houses are are often hastily built and impermanent (for versatility), they have a network of beautifully constructed libraries and temples which are the hub of each community. At the heart of Sagittarian society is truth; Who made us? Why are we here? They believe that emotional and philosophical growth is a religious practice in itself. They strive for knowledge like their cousin Gemini, but knowledge that is never cursory and always deeper than surface. Marriage is not a concept in Sagittarian society, and neither is lineage. Families may act more like friends than relatives, and be scattered far and wide throughout the islands.<\/p><p><b>Capricorn:<\/b> A mountainous, frostbitten, society, residing in elegantly constructed cave dwellings and castles with adjacent winding stone steps. Extremely advanced in the measurement of time and astronomy, they are often consulted by neighboring nations for their wiseness and practicality. Fiercely protective of their neighboring allies, Capricorns will actively follow any friendly nation into battle, but overall they are reserved, and would rather read and amass knowledge in their icy towers than to be first to initiate contact. Despite the purposeful barricades they construct to keep themselves remote, Capricornian culture is rich, loving, and deeply interested in a greater understanding of the mortal world. From their high vantage point, they keep a keen eye over the other nations, and quietly gain power.<\/p><p><b>Aquarius: <\/b>For hundreds of years, Aquarian society was simply a myth circulated amongst the bored elite of its bordering nations. Aquarian people were so extremely varied and individual, that it was difficult to identify them simply from sight. But lo, the domain of Aquarius is intensely active and teaming with life. Situated deep in the windy, temperate, mist-covered hills beneath the Leo monarchy, every Aquarian family lives by its own set of rules and abides their own laws. Despite being technically ruled democratically, their leaders are as easygoing as their people, and their schools teach mostly philosophy and a variety of other odd skills and information that enhance the trademark Aquarian cleverness. Viewed as charming and independent, they are always well received no matter where they visit. They rarely commit to allies, instead preferring to come and go as they please through each foreign nation.<\/p><p><b>Pisces:<\/b> The oldest of all twelve nations, the realm of Pisces has slowly, over a period of thousands of years, sunk further and further beneath the placid crystalline waters of the ocean. Connected to the mainland by rickety wooden docks, the only way to successfully travel to Pisces is by diving individually into the network of jeweled underwater tunnels which act as Piscean roadways. Each tunnel belongs to an air pocket and a Piscean colony, where the traveler is always welcomed after their trying journey. Piscean society values the arts, and beautiful inventive music can be heard vibrating the walls of each cave due to the fantastic acoustics. They are an extremely spiritual society, with a vast collection of deities and mythical creatures thought to peaceably roam the oceanic depths of their domain. Understandably cut off from the rest of the world, they have no use for war or conflict, and prefer the dreamy solitude of their homes.<br\/><\/p><\/blockquote>",
