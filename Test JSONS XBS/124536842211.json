It is also well suited for books you plan on \nreturning to the bookstore or books you have rented, as it does not \ninvolve writing directly in the book itself.<\/p><p>First, you’ll need to\n find a notebook, and the pens you like the best. My favorite notebooks \nto work with for note-taking, especially for my “revised” notes, are the\n Moleskine, hard or soft cover, in size extra large. For this specific \nclass (Intro to Gender and Women’s Studies), I decided that lined pages \nwould suit my needs better. For my math, engineering, and science \nclasses, I usually opt for squared paper, as I draw in lots of diagrams \nand graphs.<\/p><p>My favorite pens ever are Staedtler Triplus \nFineliners, so even though they show through the pages a little bit, I \nstill choose to use them. I just love the way they write. I usually \nwrite out my notes themselves with a Pilot G2 05 with black ink, as it \nwrites with a finer line and doesn’t bleed through quite as much.<\/p><p><b>I usually try to set up my notebooks about a week or so before class starts, that way it’s ready to go on my first day of class.<\/b><\/p><figure><p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https:\/\/64.media.tumblr.com\/b95aefe3130d7fb8f2f53416c9549d93\/tumblr_inline_nptudvFsxa1tqu5kr_540.jpg\"\/><\/p><\/figure><p>You’ll\n want to start off by setting up your notebook. On my first page, I put \nmy course code for my university, as well as the course title.<\/p><figure><p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https:\/\/64.media.tumblr.com\/3b6ae985ae197946b5125daddaf8c4f0\/tumblr_inline_nptuehokiz1tqu5kr_540.jpg\"\/><\/p><\/figure><p>Next,\n and this is perfectly optional (I just like the way it makes the book \nlook, especially at the end of the semester), I include some sort of \nrelated quote to the course. For my engineering courses (which are \nrelated to my major), I put a different quote at the beginning of each \nsection. But as this is a two-month long course during the summer, I \nopted for one quote by Mohadesa Najumi at the beginning of my book.<\/p><figure><p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https:\/\/64.media.tumblr.com\/3837d10aa4a71d3a681f49ccf1708348\/tumblr_inline_nptufsty0N1tqu5kr_540.jpg\"\/><\/p><\/figure><p>Next\n I set up my table of contents and include a page with basic course \ninformation. As this course is all online, my course information just \nincluded the start and end dates of the course, what time content is \nposted and on what day, and the name of my professor. For my usual \ncourses, I will include the days of the week the class meets on and \nwhere, TA names and contact info, as well as posted office hours for my \nprofessors and TAs and tutoring hours either in the library or in the \nCollege of Engineering.<\/p><figure><p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https:\/\/64.media.tumblr.com\/9c45fa1bc850e7f311ded097e9327270\/tumblr_inline_nptugy2qpl1tqu5kr_540.jpg\"\/><\/p><\/figure><p>Next is one of the things I’m most proud of.<\/p><p>While\n I religiously use my Erin Condren planner to map out my days, weeks, \nand months, I have found throughout my college experience that including\n monthly views for the months my class ranges has been helpful. This \nway, there’s no sifting through the multiple colors I have in my \nplanner, and everything related to that class is in the same notebook.<\/p><p>On\n this calendar I include start dates of the class, the end date, the \ndates of exams or quizzes, assignment deadlines, office hours, etc.<\/p><p>For\n this course, as I just started a few days ago, I don’t have a lot of \ndates or information, so my calendars are still very empty.<\/p><figure><p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https:\/\/64.media.tumblr.com\/17ac36bdc9b1e003081283990264489b\/tumblr_inline_nptuhoJchF1tqu5kr_540.jpg\"\/><\/p><\/figure><figure><p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https:\/\/64.media.tumblr.com\/e070ac175317a59ad939f47b3c3ce4c1\/tumblr_inline_nptui7xfZ71tqu5kr_540.jpg\"\/><\/p><\/figure><p>Next\n up I go to my weekly overview. At the beginning of each week, I set up a\n weekly layout, and I include a list of assignments, tests, quizzes, \ntasks, projects, etc that need my attention throughout the week, and I \nplace the days I plan on doing them or the days they need turned in onto\n the weekly layout.<\/p><figure><p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https:\/\/64.media.tumblr.com\/684191a70da367c3ff2ec5683fe3e939\/tumblr_inline_nptuixMWxA1tqu5kr_540.jpg\"\/><\/p><\/figure><p>Now you’re finally ready to get into taking the notes.<\/p><p>Gather your book, some sticky notes, and your favorite pen or pencil.<\/p><p>I\n color code my stickies so that the “revision” process later goes a bit \nsmoother. In this case, I’m using blue to denote something interesting, \nintriguing, or thought provoking, greenish-yellow to represent the facts\n or important concepts, and pink for important vocabulary words and \ntheir definitions.<\/p><figure><p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https:\/\/64.media.tumblr.com\/0f758ba22b7a007713bf95524d9afd96\/tumblr_inline_nptujxPo4L1tqu5kr_540.jpg\"\/><\/p><\/figure><p>Read the selection once.<\/p><p>As\n you read along the second time, write notes on your stickies, and place\n them in a place of relevance directly on the page in the book. Just \nmake sure you don’t cover up anything you need to keep reading.<\/p><figure><p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https:\/\/64.media.tumblr.com\/0d85b8f7b3277a8e8ef81df97341548b\/tumblr_inline_nptujpSUJB1tqu5kr_540.jpg\"\/><\/p><\/figure><figure><p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https:\/\/64.media.tumblr.com\/24b6ed73a25b3f1f48234b50f80894fd\/tumblr_inline_nptukbRval1tqu5kr_540.jpg\"\/><\/p><\/figure><figure><p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https:\/\/64.media.tumblr.com\/5f8cdaab45ebdb1e6fe249ebbf22112c\/tumblr_inline_nptuklNG6R1tqu5kr_540.jpg\"\/><\/p><\/figure><p>Now,\n once you’ve read all the material in questions (you can choose to break\n it up however you want, but since Chapter 1 was assigned for the week, \nI’ve elected to break it into chapters), carefully remove your stickies \none by one and lay them out on a flat surface. This is when having a \nseparate color for vocab can be helpful, as I sometimes put all of my \nvocab at the beginning or end of a section, especially if the section of\n reading was particularly large.<\/p><p>Organize your stickies in an \norder that makes sense to you, and use this order as your basis for \ntransferring those notes into your notebook. The order you choose can \njust be lumping them under similar headings. Some classes even lend \nthemselves to a nice chronological order. Whatever you choose, just make\n sure it’s something that will make sense to you when you come back to \nit in the end.<\/p><figure><p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https:\/\/64.media.tumblr.com\/ed701b3ea7b0c38e23ac21e0f69f8dfa\/tumblr_inline_nptuledABM1tqu5kr_540.jpg\"\/><\/p><\/figure><p>Okay so up there I wasn’t following my own advice, I just thought I would include the picture because my handwriting looks nice…<br\/><\/p><figure><p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https:\/\/64.media.tumblr.com\/ba997fa7ebbcd617603674e40ae31495\/tumblr_inline_nptumsjDzU1tqu5kr_540.jpg\"\/><\/p><\/figure><p>Now organize the stickies!<\/p><figure><p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https:\/\/64.media.tumblr.com\/58f6393a369736feb6451de23d8d184b\/tumblr_inline_nptuom1XCq1tqu5kr_540.jpg\"\/><\/p><\/figure><p>Now you just \nstart writing everything from the stickies into your notebook. I like to\n take each category or subgroup and put them in the book on the facing \npage, then put them back in my textbook as I finish with each post it.<\/p><figure><p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https:\/\/64.media.tumblr.com\/6f4937eff5021c17bc6cf50624e57e3f\/tumblr_inline_nptup8l1uv1tqu5kr_540.jpg\"\/><\/p><\/figure><p>Moving on to the next category.<\/p><figure><p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https:\/\/64.media.tumblr.com\/5c4996a1e9269443f9a24c31cbde7049\/tumblr_inline_nptupnZcCh1tqu5kr_540.jpg\"\/><\/p><\/figure><figure><p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https:\/\/64.media.tumblr.com\/40d22a5bc365e2dd38002dbbcfbdc552\/tumblr_inline_nptuq32MG21tqu5kr_540.jpg\"\/><\/p><\/figure><p>Before you know it, you’ve written all of your stickies into your notebooks.<\/p><figure><p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https:\/\/64.media.tumblr.com\/e6b7d44e94ad2e22bfb9c0811075c217\/tumblr_inline_nptuqryQ6w1tqu5kr_540.jpg\"\/><\/p><\/figure><p>Now\n you’re revved up and ready to go. You can either keep going and make a \nnote summary page (which I’ll show you next week), or you can leave it. \nThese will also be helpful when reviewing for tests and quizzes. You can\n highlight or underline, or use even more stickies (which is what I usually do) as you review.<\/p><p>Well, that’s all I have for you right now.
