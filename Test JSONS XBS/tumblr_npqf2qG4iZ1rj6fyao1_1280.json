They don’t always do all of their homework.<\/b><\/p><p>In college, homework assignments generally make up 5-20% of\nyour grade, but can be the biggest time-suck for most students. Yes, working\nproblems is one of the best ways to turn new concepts into working knowledge,\nbut a large majority of those problems that take you hours and hours to work\nthrough, you’ll never see on an exam.<\/p><p><b>2. They never “read through” the textbook.<\/b><\/p><p><a href=\"http:\/\/themetapicture.com\/i-know-some-of-these-symbols\/\"><br\/><\/a>Per time spent, reading the textbook is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vox.com\/2014\/6\/24\/5824192\/study-smarter-learn-better-8-tips-from-memory-researchers\">one of the least effective methods for learning new material.<\/a> Top\nstudents use the examples and practice problems, but otherwise use Google,\nlecture notes, and old exams for study materials.<\/p><p><b>3. They Google EVERYTHING.<\/b><\/p><p>It’s like an automatic reaction. New concept = go\nto Google for a quick explanation. Don’t think just because your professor\ngives you a textbook and some examples on the blackboard that you’re limited to\nthat information. You have a massive free search engine at your fingertips, so\nmake use of it.<\/p><p><b>4. They test themselves frequently.<\/b><\/p><p>Testing yourself strengthens your brain’s connections to new\nmaterial, and gives you immediate and clear feedback on whether you know\nsomething or not. Bottom line, <a href=\"http:\/\/memory.psych.purdue.edu\/downloads\/2006_Roediger_Karpicke_PsychSci.pdf\">repeated self-testing significantly improves long-term retention of new\nmaterial. <\/a><\/p><p><b>5. They study in short bursts, not long marathons.<\/b><\/p><p>Studying in short bursts tends to help you focus intensely\nbecause you know there is at least a short break coming.<\/p><p>This also fits in nicely with our <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ultradian_rhythm\">Ultradian\nRhythm<\/a>, the natural activity\/rest cycle of our bodies, which makes\nstudying continuously for multiple hours on end counterproductive.<\/p><p><b>6. They reverse-engineer solved problems.<\/b><\/p><p>It’s one thing to follow and memorize a set of steps to\nsolve a calculus problem. It’s an entirely different thing to understand what a\nderivative is, be able to take derivates of complex functions, know when to use\nthe chain rule vs. the product rule, etc. The problem with simply following the\nsteps the professor provided, or the textbook outlines, is that you’re only\nachieving a surface-level knowledge of the problem. Top students, instead,<a href=\"http:\/\/wtfprofessor.com\/the-reverse-learning-technique\/\">take\nsolved problems and work backwards<\/a>, from solution to question, asking\n“why.”<\/p><p>Why did this get this value?<br\/>\nWhy did they simplify this expression?<br\/>\nWhy did they use that type of derivative rule?<\/p><p>By following this process, you begin to understand the\ninterconnections of the concept, and how to directly apply that to a problem.\nThis “working knowledge” of a concept is key to performing well on exams,\nespecially on problems that you haven’t seen before.<\/p><p><b>7. They don’t own a highlighter.<\/b><\/p><p>Highlighting anything = unengaged reading. If you want to\nnote something that stands out, underline and write a corresponding note to go\nalong with it. Or better yet, write yourself a note summarizing the item in\nyour own words.<\/p><p><b>8. They sleep–a lot.<\/b><\/p><p>The daily routines of top performers, in any field, are\ncharacterized by periods of intense work (4-6 hours per day) <a href=\"http:\/\/calnewport.com\/blog\/2011\/11\/11\/if-youre-busy-youre-doing-something-wrong-the-surprisingly-relaxed-lives-of-elite-achievers\/\">followed by significant quantities of high-quality sleep<\/a> (9\nhours per night). You see this trend in top violin prodigies and chess\nchampions, as well as elite athletes. The idea is to alternate periods of intense\nwork with rest, so that you create tons of new connections in your nervous\nsystem, and then allow adequate time to assimilate those gains.<\/p><p><b>9. They engage themselves by asking questions.<\/b><\/p><p>What happens if I tell you, “Thomas Jefferson almost\nsingle-handedly drafted the Delcaration of Independence in 1776.”?<\/p><p>You might say “Hmm.. that’s interesting”, try to remember it\nfor later, maybe even write down a note or two.<\/p><p>But what if I ask you, “Who was Thomas Jefferson?” What\nchanges?<\/p><p>You start searching your memory, sifting through images of\nold guys, founding fathers, thinking about the Declaration of Independence. You\ncome up with your own narrative, and then realize that you have gaps.<\/p><p>When was he around again?<br\/>\nAnd why was he so important?<\/p><p>You’ll probably find yourself going to Google to fill in the\ngaps. Through that process your learning will be much more deeply seated in\nyour brain than anything your history teacher ever told you about him. That’s\nthe power of asking questions.<\/p><p><b>10. They make the best out of lecture.<\/b><\/p><p><br\/>\nYes, your professor sucks. Yes, lectures are boring. Yes, it’s either too fast\nso you can’t keep up and miss all the important stuff, or it’s way too slow and\nyou start zoning out because you already understand everything.<\/p><p>The best students look at this this way: I’m going to\nbe there no matter what, so what’s the best use of my time while I’m in the\nclassroom? Ask questions, bring the textbook and look stuff up, focus on the\nimportant practice problems to copy down in your notes, try to anticipate what\nthe professor is going to say, make note of anything they put emphasis on as a\npotential exam topic. All of these things make the time you have to spend in\nlecture more productive and engaging. And that’s less time you have to spend\nstudying later on.<\/p><p><b>11. They over-learn.<\/b><\/p><p>School is hard enough, with the amount of studying and\nhomework you have to do. And on top of all of that Facebooking you have to get\ndone? It might seem ridiculous to suggest learning<i> more<\/i> than\nyou have to.<\/p><p>What!? Are you insane!?<\/p><p>But this is precisely what top students do. And\nparadoxically, they end up spending <i>less<\/i> time trying to\nunderstand how to do homework problems, and<i>less<\/i> time studying for\nexams because of it. Because when you “over-learn” past what’s presented in\nclass, you build a better framework for the subject.<\/p><p>Think of trying to remember some details about Abraham\nLincoln’s life. You try to remember the dates of the Civil War, or what he said\nin the Emancipation Proclamation. You study the same facts over and over and\nover again… but it’s just boring, and you quickly forget. But what if you knew\nhis whole life’s story? About how Lincoln suffered from bouts of depression,\nand his relationship with his wife suffered? You start to learn that the dude\nwas human, and you start to relate to the things he did and the struggles he\nwent through. Now you’ve constructed a story in your head. And studies show\nthat humans learn best through stories. So yes, it’s more information, but your\nbrain knows what to do with it now that all those random facts are linked\ntogether. More learning, but less rote memorization and struggling to remember\nrandom facts.<\/p><p><b>12. They immediately study their exam mistakes.<\/b><\/p><p>Most students get their exam grade back, flip through to see\nif the professor made any mistakes they can argue about, and then promptly\nshove it into their notebook, never to be seen again until the mad scramble at\nthe end of the semester to study for the final.<\/p><p>Instead, top students ignore what they got <i>right<\/i>,\nand use their mistakes as an indicator of what to improve on.<\/p><p><b>13. They’re busy with work and side projects.<\/b><\/p><p>Yes, to do well in a course, you need to focus and put in\nthe hours. But like many geniuses throughout history have shown, involvement in\na diverse set of subjects, activities, and skill sets keeps you active, and\nprovides you with a rich and diverse set of mental models to pull from.<\/p><p>Also, as they say, “If you need to get something done, give\nit to the busy person.” If you stay active in multiple areas, you don’t have time\nto procrastinate, and are forced to be efficient with your study time. This\ngenerally translates into quicker learning and better performance throughout\nthe semester.<\/p><p><b>14. They use lecture as a detective mission.<\/b><\/p><p>Though completely unaware of this fact, your professor has\ntells. Yes, like in poker. Tells during lecture will hint at particular types\nof concepts and problems that will be emphasized on the midterm or final exam.\nThe best students pay attention to topics professors spend a seemingly inordinate\namount of time on and make note. Chances are you’ll see something related on\nthe final.<\/p><p><b>15. They don’t wait for motivation to strike.<\/b><\/p><p><a href=\"http:\/\/jamesclear.com\/schedule\">Motivation\ncomes and goes<\/a>, but studying for a degree requires persistence and\nconsistency. Just like Olympic athletes train even on their worst days, the\nbest students figure out how to get their coursework done when it’s the last\nthing they want to do.<\/p><p><b>16. They practice under test conditions.<\/b><a href=\"http:\/\/themetapicture.com\/last-minutes\/\"><br\/><\/a>The old adage “practice makes perfect” isn’t totally true. Deliberate\npractice under the right conditions, with the correct mindset, is more like it.\nInstead of reading through all of the lecture notes and redoing old homework\nproblems, top students make themselves practice exams, and rehearse their exam\nperformance, under time pressure and in similar conditions (no notes,\nuncomfortable chair, quiet room, etc.) to what they’ll see on test day.<b><\/b><\/p><p><b>17. They use old exams.<\/b><\/p><p>Professors aren’t the most inventive folk. Along with coming\nup with lecture material and departmental responsibilities, they’re also\nprimarily concerned with research. So typically midterms and final exams more\nor less look alike for similar courses year-to-year and even across\nuniversities. Because of this, old exams are a gold mine of opportunity for\nfiguring out what problems you should be able to solve and study from.<\/p><p><b>18. They make their own study guides.<\/b><\/p><p>The best students don’t simply use the study guide the\nteacher provides, they create their own.<\/p><p>Creating the study guide is half the battle, requiring you\nto go through your notes, consolidate them, and organize them in a way that you\nunderstand–all valuable study activities. You’ll also be able to use your\nequations sheet much more effectively on the exam itself (if allowed) because\nyou know exactly where everything is.<\/p><p><b>19. They actually write on paper.<\/b><\/p><p>Writing out notes on a laptop is efficient. Too efficient.\nBecause it’s so easy to quickly type out exactly what the professor is saying,\nyou don’t have to do the work of trying to figure out how to consolidate the\ninformation into your own shorthand. Some also believe that the act of writing\nhelps retain more information.<\/p><p><b>20. They use the 80\/20 rule.<\/b><\/p><p>Yes, some students who get good grades do every reading\nassignment, finish every practice problem, and attend every study session they\ncan get their hands on. But these students are missing the point. There will\nalways be an endless amount of information you <i>could<\/i> learn\ngiven the time and effort, but having the ability to discern what is <i>worth<\/i> learning\nwill truly set you apart.<\/p><p>Top students identify the 20% of concepts they need to learn\ndeeply, in order to determine 80% of their final grade. They focus intently on\nthose few things, and simply ignore the rest. This is a formula for high\nperformance, without hours and hours of busywork. And it translates seamlessly\ninto the real world too.<\/p><p><b>21. They don’t complain.<\/b><\/p><p>Complaining simply has no place in the smart student’s\nrepertoire. If something sucks, change it or ignore it, but don’t waste your\ntime, energy, and mental state talking about it. Got a crappy professor? Either\nswitch class sections or focus on teaching yourself. Horrible textbook? Find\nalternate resources (Google is free in case you hadn’t heard).<\/p><p><b>22. They learn by doing.<\/b><\/p><p>Any technical subject can only truly be internalized through\nuse. Just like learning a new language, learning to be fluent in algebra or\ncalculus requires active application of rules and formulas. Top students\nknow there is a big difference between knowledge, and applied knowledge.<\/p><p><b>23. They take personal responsibility for learning the\nmaterial.<\/b><\/p><p>The best students understand that they, and only they are\ntruly responsible for their own education. So waiting to be spoon-fed by your\nprofessor and doing the homework assignments will never be enough. Despite your\nschool’s best intentions, they’ll never be as committed to your academic\nsuccess as you can be.<\/p><p><b>24.<\/b> <b>Following\nwhat they love<\/b><\/p><p>Those students you admire are passionate about what they are\nlearning. They have the drive to develop their learning further based on their\nlove of what they are discovering. This may not always be the case and is often\nunavoidable but if you follow what interests you and cultivate a curiosity of\nthis area, your motivation to learn will thrive.<\/p><p>Not every student is the same and many top students don’t\nfollow the status quo. The best way to create good habits for students is to\ntry a variety of techniques and figure out what works for you.<\/p><p><b>25<\/b>. <b>Question\nyour teachers<\/b><br\/>\nThinking outside the box is a cliche but certainly a reality for students.\n They question everything–especially test questions they get wrong.\n This attitude is important because it shows a general inquisitiveness\nthat is essential in learning.  As any parent of small children knows,\nquestions are a way to gain knowledge.  Teachers can’t be offended when a\nstudent asks a difficult question and parents should encourage this behavior.  <\/p><p><b>26. They know the\nbest way to study.<\/b><\/p><p>It is important to know the best way to study for yourself.\nDo you need pictures? Sounds? Study better in quiet or noisy environments?\nFigure out what works best for you so that you can make the most out of your\nstudy time.<\/p><p><b>27. They play hard.<\/b><\/p><p>We all know that a balanced lifestyle is the best way to\nstay mentally and physically healthy! Top students don’t spend all day in the\nlibrary grafting (contrary to what you might think!) Rather, they take the time\nto put their studies aside and do something which is fun and exciting!<\/p><blockquote><p><i> Source : <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lifehack.org\/articles\/productivity\/23-things-top-students.html\">1<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.examtime.com\/blog\/good-habits-for-students\/\">2<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/blogs\/answer-sheet\/wp\/2013\/02\/20\/five-habits-of-great-students-lessons-from-top-ranked-stem-school\/\">3<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/stoogle.co.za\/10-habits-that-top-students-practice\/\">4<\/a><\/i><\/p><\/blockquote><\/blockquote>",
