  "regular-body": "<p><a class=\"tumblr_blog\" href=\"http:\/\/idiosyncraticwordsmith.tumblr.com\/post\/124377775231\">idiosyncraticwordsmith<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: This is the <i>beauty<\/i> of the Aspects, and does not necessarily have to do with anything sexual - rather, these are more about the impressions and airs of each aspect, and the aesthetic given off by their players.<\/p>\n<p><b>Space<\/b>: Space players have the beauty of creation - that of cosmos and stars and the heavens themselves - an effortless, natural beauty. To imagine their beauty, think of the feeling you feel when you look at the stars or a forest or a waterfall and feel overwhelmed with the beauty of creation itself. Wherever they go, whatever they do, however they present themselves, they will always leave people mentally whispering to themselves, “damn…”<\/p>\n<p><b>Time<\/b>: Time players possess the beauty of apocalypse. Meteor showers, blizzards, thunderstorms - the beauty of the nature of destruction and of time itself cloaks them like a blanket. Theirs is the aspect of destruction, and people can always feel an aura of potential in them - they are ticking time bombs, and it is the things they’re capable of, be they destructive or otherwise, are what strike awe in the hearts of those around them. Should they start making music, the room will hush to hear it.<\/p>\n<p><b>Breath<\/b>: Breath players have the beauty of chaos, of the butterfly effect, of the way that no breeze blows the same way twice and no cloud looks the same. They are unpredictable and whimsical and yet always know what direction they’re going, even if they don’t know what their destination is. Wherever their breeze takes them, it carries an air of direction and freedom, and that breezy nature is what turns heads towards them.<\/p>\n<p><b>Blood<\/b>: Blood players are encased in the hard, rough beauty of getting shit done and getting it done right. The sensation one feels when they fulfill an obligation, the rush of satisfying the demands placed upon them, that is the feeling embodied by Blood players. They may have an edge to them, and their character can feel like a jagged rock, but even jagged gems shimmer in the eyes of their finders.<\/p>\n<p><b>Light<\/b>: Light players shine with the beauty of the spotlight. When they’re in their element, “in the zone”, they represent the sensation felt at the precise moment when playing a game with someone and it becomes evident that you will come out on top. That radiant victory is what keeps the limelight focused on them.<\/p>\n<p><b>Void<\/b>: Void players eminate the beauty of absence. Their forms capture the feeling of being alone after a long day around crowds, or the silence and darkness that fills the club when it closes down for the night after a sick rave. Like a black and white photograph or a silent movie, there is something about them that seems to be missing, and yet it is that very absence that makes them impossible to ignore.<\/p>\n<p><b>Mind<\/b>: Mind players have the beauty of order. When a straight piece falls perfectly in line and makes 4 rows disappear in a game of Tetris, when a stack of books is perfectly aligned and perfectly proportioned from large base to small tip, when you find just the perfect word to describe what you’re thinking of - these moments are what comprise Mind players. It is the way every step falls just right, every motion seems orchestrated, that makes passerbys notice them.<\/p>\n<p><b>Heart<\/b>: Heart players have the beauty of confidence. The way a professional approaches a job with no hesitation, no question; the air of a model strutting down the runway; a musician playing the song they’ve played for years; these are the aesthetics captured by Heart players. With a sense of self and no time for reservation, the way they cut through the air makes waves that get attention.<\/p>\n<p><b>Doom<\/b>: Doom players give off the beauty of fate. Rare is it that “doom” is considered beautiful, but Doom is something beautiful in and of itself - it is Doom that gave us dinosaur bones to uncover, ancient ruins to explore, and rows of gravestones to remember and learn from. Days gone by, never to return but perhaps refrain in echoes of themselves forever after, the ever-moving hand of fate, these things are captured by Doom players, and it is this air of eternity that makes other mere mortals transfix on them.<br\/><\/p>\n<p><b>Hope<\/b>: Hope players shine with the beauty of will and miracles. The soldier making it home, the terminally ill refusing death’s embrace and somehow returning to health, the lover fighting off their beloved’s attackers, the hero diving into the river to save the drowning child - these bold, fiery hearts give off the same smoke as a Hope player. This intense heat of dedication and the scent of fiery will warms those around them and makes it difficult to ignore them when they’re near.<\/p>\n<p><b>Life<\/b>: Life players exude the beauty of living. The way flowers and mosses will grow through every crack in the concrete - or <i>make<\/i> a crack to grow through -the fact that nature will take back every inch of land humanity has taken from her, the miracle of birth and of defying death, these are the things that a Life player encapsulates in their walk and stance. Like a vibrant flower or vivid painting, you can’t ignore Life players for long.<\/p>\n<p><b>Rage<\/b>: Rage players have the beauty of restraint and expression. Lightning in a bottle, fire in a jar, rage behind a mask, a demon chained and caged - these are the kin of the Rage player. The storms inside of them purrs quietly, awaiting release, and the composure shown on their face as they contain it is beatific. It is the saintly aura given by Rage players, single-handedly restraining themselves despite their intense emotions, that captures the hearts and minds of the people around them.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>",
