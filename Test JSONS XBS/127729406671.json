He spends the entire story trying to discover who they are and how to send the back to hell except at the end <i>he realizes he’s got it all wrong. <\/i><\/p>\n<p>It isn’t the girl who had three different boy friends and was always willing to spend time with him who was Lust, it was his friend that kept saying how all the girls were totally into him and it was a crime they just weren’t going to admit it. <\/p>\n<p>Gluttony isn’t the overweight girl who’s constantly stress eating but his friend that convinces him that there’s no such thing as too much beer\/weed. <\/p>\n<p>The accountant major on the student council who’s always hounding at people to spend within their budget isn’t Greed, but his friend who convinces him that loaning even a single pen isn’t worth it because what if you need it later and that guy definitely isn’t going to give it back to you when he’s done. <\/p>\n<p>Sloth isn’t the girl who is always sleeping in class, but his friend who spends most of his time trying to get people do to things for him. <\/p>\n<p>The girl who destroyed her boyfriend’s stuff when she found out that he cheated on her isn’t Wrath, it’s his friend who thinks a punch to the shoulder is a hug and yells at anyone who dares to disagree with him. <\/p>\n<p>Envy isn’t the president of the student council who is always on the front page of something and can’t quit talking about her goals and dreams, but his friend who is the nicest guy in the world until you forget to say thank or don’t talk about his newest achievement for a week straight. <\/p>\n<p>Not only has this guy it wrong, he’s accidentally banished a few of the Seven Heavenly Virtues because he didn’t know they were also on campus and thought they were Sins. (Kindness can look like disguised Lust to some minds, Prudence can be confused with Greed.) I want him to be all confused and then turn to his friends who reveal themselves and say:<\/p>\n<p>“We’re sins. Of course we were by your side this whole time. We’re by everyone’s side-”<br\/><\/p>\n<p>“From the moment you’re born-” <br\/><\/p>\n<p>“To the moment you die.” <br\/><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>",
