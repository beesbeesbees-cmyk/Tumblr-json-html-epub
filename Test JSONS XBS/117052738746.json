But there are some things you never buy generic, including: peanut butter, ketchup, liquid NyQuil, Chips-Ahoy chewy chocolate chip cookies<\/li>\n<li>just imagine the person on the other end of the phone hates talking on the phone as much as you do. Even a receptionist. I worked as one and I hate talking on the phone<\/li>\n<li>at least once in your life you will go to Wal-mart to buy something under $20 like an ironing board or something and your debit card will get rejected. No one will judge. Everyone at some point in their lives has had $2.98 in their bank account. <\/li>\n<li>thrift stores<\/li>\n<li>everyone else is too busy panicking about everyone else noticing every tiny thing that could possibly be wrong about them to notice any tiny thing that could possibly be wrong about you<\/li>\n<li>you will screw up. a lot. you live and you learn. and when you start to think too hard about that embarrassing thing that happened and how you wish you could change it, just tell yourself that what’s done is done. There’s no changing it, so just forget it and move on. It’s the only way to stay sane.<\/li>\n<li>do the dishes before the sink grows its own ecosystem<\/li>\n<li>you can’t put Dawn dishsoap in the dishwasher. <\/li>\n<li>if you are the only one in the aisle at the grocery store, and you need to get from one end to the other without even looking at anything in that aisle, then you should totally cart-surf down the aisle. Growing old is mandatory. Growing up is optional. Hold on to the little things. They make all the difference.<\/li>\n<li>never try to make cake from scratch at 3am. You end up with a topographical map of Middle Earth.<\/li>\n<li>15% tip. <\/li>\n<li>the best way to get money for food is to tell your grandparents about how you basically live on microwaved mac and cheese. Their horror may result in twenty bucks and orders to go out and get yourself “a real dinner”.<\/li>\n<li>sometimes life sucks, and knowing that it might get better doesn’t always make it suck any less, but you’ll never get to the non-sucky days without enduring the suckiness. <\/li>\n<li>no seriously, NEVER put Dawn in your dishwasher<\/li>\n<li><img src=\"https:\/\/64.media.tumblr.com\/tumblr_m91enr2Dx41qkq2ws.jpg\" alt=\"image\"\/><\/li>\n<\/ul><\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Do not buy generic brand spaghetti sauce either.<\/p><p>Always check the type of light bulb that goes in lamps. A 60w is not interchangeable with a 40w.<\/p><p>Dollar store batteries work just as well as store brand.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n<ul><li>Reward yourself from time to time when you do things that you needed to get done. It’s a good way to remind yourself to do them. Going out to pay a bill? Get Starbucks or something you don’t get often. Rewards don’t have to be huge, they can be small things like that.<br\/><\/li><li>Rice, pasta, flour, sugar, cheese, eggs, milk, a pack of chicken, a pack of frozen veggies and a well stocked spice cabinet go a long way food-wise. Splurge and get the biggest container of rice you can. You don’t have to go back and buy it again anytime soon and it makes a TON of meals in the meantime.<\/li><li>Rice can be cooked on the stove. You don’t need a fancy rice cooker. Two parts water to every one part rice (two cups water for one cup of rice for example). Get your water boiling, add rice, put a plate or lid on it, put it on low for 20 minutes. It should be done.<\/li><li>Keep a calendar on your pc of bill due dates. If your bills are set up at inconvenient times, like all of the services started on the first or something, then call up the company and find out if you can get your billing date switched to something more manageable. A lot of places do try to work with you.<\/li><li>There is no shame in calling a company and asking for an extension on a bill. Let them know what you can pay, pay that amount, and they arrange when the rest of the payment is required. This can stop you from having services shut off man. It shows responsibility on your part.<\/li><li>Take time to eat, even when you don’t feel like eating. Your body needs energy to live.<\/li><li>Wash or rinse your dishes before putting them in the dishwasher. It prevents gross caked on junk.<\/li><li>“The Works” is an excellent cheap toilet cleaner.<\/li><li>MAGIC. FUCKING. ERASERS. THEY WORK ON EVERYTHING JUST DON’T SCRUB HARD. I took the ring out of our bathtub with one. Also generic ones work just as well.<\/li><\/ul><figure data-orig-width=\"204\" data-orig-height=\"195\"><img src=\"https:\/\/64.media.tumblr.com\/4ee779cc328f67358e0fec1b81e48781\/tumblr_inline_nn5un40gU61qeuaoo_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"204\" data-orig-height=\"195\"\/><\/figure><ul><li>Keep some bleach around but if you use it for cleaning? Dillute it. There’s rarely ever a case where you need to pout straight bleach on anything. A cap full or two in a bucket of water works just fine.<br\/><\/li><li>DO NOT MIX CLEANERS. Chemical reactions are can be very dangerous. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/peggy\/16-common-product-combinations-you-should-never-mix#.wd512kZEQ\">Here’s a good list.<\/a> (Note that vinegar and baking soda can actually be a good combo for removing smells from things but it’s not very good at actually -cleaning-.)<br\/><\/li><li>If you drink? Don’t take meds at the same time it’s just not good.<\/li><li>Make sure you check the dosages on your pill bottles. No one wants to accidentally overdose on cough syrup or ibuprofen.<\/li><li>If you have a uterus make sure you have a heating pad and ibuprofen on hand for the pain. Hot baths also generally help and Ginger Tea is excellent for any nausea.<\/li><li>Buy a first aid kit. It’s worth it in the long run.<\/li><li>You can often do your taxes online at places like TurboTax.<\/li><li>Here’s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ohjoysextoy.com\/category\/comic\/education-comic\/\">some<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.scarleteen.com\/\">good<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.plannedparenthood.org\/\">sex ed resources<\/a> because I had to explain what a yeast infection was recently. <\/li><li>Petroleum jelly (aka Vaseline) is good for chapped lips and you can get a decent sized tube or tub of it (generic brand version) for cheaper\/same price as Chapstick.<\/li><li>KEEP TRIPLE ANTIBIOTIC OINTMENT IN YOUR HOUSE FOR CUTS AND SCRAPES AND SORES. <\/li><\/ul><p><b>~~Medications~~<\/b><\/p><p>Over the counter medications (stuff you can buy right off the shelf no prescription needed) have a name brand and a generic name. ALWAYS buy generic if it’s available it is literally the same thing and way cheaper usually.<\/p><p>Some names to remember when you’re looking for meds!<\/p><p><b>Acetaminophen = Tylenol<\/b><\/p><p>Used to treat pain and reduce fever. Do not take with Ibuprofen.<\/p><p><b>Ibuprofen = Advil, Midol, Motrin<\/b><\/p><p>Used for pain and fever, is an anti-inflammtory. Is good for period cramps because it is an NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug).<\/p><p><b>Naproxen = Aleve, Naprosyn<\/b><\/p><p>Treats fever, pain, arthritis pain, gout, period cramps, tendinitis, headache, backache, and toothache. Is also an NSAID.<\/p><p><b>Acetaminophen + Asprin + Caffeine = Excedrin<\/b><\/p><p>Usually marketed as “Migraine Relief” as a generic.<\/p><p><b>Asprin = Bayer<\/b><\/p><p>Use for pain, fever, arthritis, and inflammation. Makes you bleed easily so should not be used for periods. Might reduce risk of heart attacks.\\<\/p><p><b>Triple Antibiotic Ointment = Neosporin<\/b><\/p><p>Used on cuts, sores, and scrapes to reduce risk of infection and promote healing.<\/p><p><br\/><\/p><p>Also a general mutli-vitamin isn’t a bad idea and if you don’t get a lot of fruits or milk\/sunshine in your diet you might want to get vitamins C and D specifically for daily use.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n<p>• be careful with magic erasers they can take paint off of things.
