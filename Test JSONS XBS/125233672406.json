The Empress caught word of Ancestcaptor’s descendant early on enough to essentially cull him and prepare him to be a powerful psionic prophet working for the hierarchy of the Beforan Empire. As such, he had a lot of unrealistic expectations embedded in his psyche (which seriously impacted his behavior up until “The Incident”); it got to the point of teachers not bothering to learn his actual name and just calling him a diminutive of his future position, “Mituna”. Naturally, he forgot he ever had an identity besides it.<br\/><br\/>You know. Since Gemini are twins.<br\/><\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>General Opinion over said character: <\/b>L00L K1NKY #!! #!!!!

When Latula and Mituna start dating, Kankri denies they were ever friends and is the main catalyst of destroying his credibility and indirectly forcing him to face “The Incident” alone. He realized this somewhere in the mix of being dead, but takes out his anger over it on Mituna, since OBVIOUSLY he can do no wrong himself.<\/li><li><b>General Opinion over said character: <\/b>brings up bad memories, overcompensates and is a total asshole i like to hate because of it<\/li><\/ul><p><b>LATULA<\/b><\/p><ul><li><b>Sexuality Headcanon:<\/b> Either Ace or Demi<\/li><li><b>Gender Headcanon: <\/b>(I am really really boring and not experienced enough in this field) Definitely uses she\/her (i am not solid on specifications im so sorry)<\/li><li><b>A ship I have with said character: <\/b>Mitula<\/li><li><b>A BROTP I have with said character:<\/b> Porrim and Latula, possibly after a spades fling?<\/li><li><b>A NOTP I have with said character: <\/b>Kantula<\/li><li><b>A random headcanon: <\/b>Latula seeks out indie Flash games to cope with sudden anxiety at unholy hours of the daytime, memorizing their stories and playing through every multiple-ending.
