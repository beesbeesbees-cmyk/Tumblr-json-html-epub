  "regular-body": "<p>CHARON was the mythological ferryman of the River Styx who brought souls into the Greek afterlife. He’s lawfully neutral, so long as the body of the deceased was either a Greek hero, or buried properly and supplied with an appropriate toll, referred to as Charon’s obol. <\/p><!-- more --><p>As a denizen, he offers Mituna the following choice:<\/p><ul><li>Kill off every other member of his session by his own hand, sparing them the agonies of their hopeless game. Or,<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>Sacrifice his livelihood (which Mituna takes to mean his literal life, which Charon means to be his psi, which at that point Mituna valued more than his own life) to buy time for the Scratch to occur (something after them, a hope for the future) and to guarantee passage to an afterlife (dreambubbles)<br\/><\/li><\/ul><p>There has yet to be a recorded timeline wherein he chooses the first option.<\/p><figure data-orig-width=\"97\" data-orig-height=\"130\"><img src=\"https:\/\/64.media.tumblr.com\/770fc0baf1356c707e94bcf4ce97a862\/tumblr_inline_nuanrkIkQO1trzovr_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"97\" data-orig-height=\"130\"\/><\/figure><p>In order to satisfy the toll, Mituna makes three offerings. First, he outright sacrifices his realself, waking up as his Prospitian dreamself and offering the corpse as a blood sacrifice. Charon refuses, and the body dissolves into pixelesque dark-green sludge. Next, upon the death of his Dersite dreamself, he offers up its remains (with a snide commentary about how the purple pajamas and his yellow-ochre blood clash “just right”, about how he never felt like Derse suited him much anyway) which are once again denied. Finally, after his last act of martyrdom (”The Incident”), Charon appears to him in his dying dream. The final offering he makes is his “mind” (his psionic powers, primarily, as well as his coherence and fluidity of thought), which is at last accepted. As his reward, he’s brought back among the living, with his “heart” (read: soul; who he really is underneath all that capital-D Doom and gloom, expectations placed upon him, perceived usefulness as a tool, etc.) intact. <\/p><p>In real life, Charon&rsquo;s obol was a coin formed from precious metal (generally bronze or silver, but sometimes gold) engraved with various symbols. The coin would be placed in the mouth of the deceased at burial, in order for them to access it in the afterlife and exchange it for passage across the River Styx. As a part of Mituna&rsquo;s quest, it would take on a much more metaphorical meaning. However, Charon&rsquo;s stoicism would remain the same&ndash; and be an axis of his designation as a Doom player&rsquo;s denizen. The rule of the toll is consistent and logical, plus theoretically inevitable for all to come across. This fits in with the view of Doom as strictly order-based, adhering to the inevitable, and centered especially on decay: it directly opposes the Life aspect&rsquo;s spontaneity and emphasis on creation .<\/p><p><i>Trivia, and further Headcanons:<\/i><\/p><ul><li>In Beforan Psion mythos, contrary to popular Western mythos in real life, the number four is seen as an excellent omen while the number three spells certain destruction. This adds to the designation that Mituna appeals to Charon <i>three times<\/i>.<\/li><li>An obol (as it was used as currency, not as an artifact nowadays) was worth approximately $4.17 USD in 1990; 413 with an additional aforementioned <i>four.<\/i><\/li><li>This particular obol I found while researching seemed too serendipitous not to share&ndash; it&rsquo;s engraved with what appears to be a honeybee.<\/li><\/ul><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"240\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/64.media.tumblr.com\/253534452728c9c1982eaca9db9fddfa\/tumblr_inline_nuanmvgzax1trzovr_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"240\"\/><\/figure><ul><li>For some psionic good luck, a fourth bullet point showing an interesting tidbit about Life\/Doom aspect duality: If Life can be described as concerning continuous growth, and Doom can be described as concerning continuous Decay, they&rsquo;d be calculated using the same formula of<b> y(t) = Pe<sup>rt<\/sup><\/b>. Here, the amount of your material at a given time [y(t)] is equal to the amount you started with [P] multiplied by Euler&rsquo;s number (like in logarithms; the button is on most calculators!) to the power of time [t] multiplied by rate [r]. If r is more than 0, the material is growing. If r is less than 0, the material is decaying. Two sides of the same coin.<\/li><\/ul>",
