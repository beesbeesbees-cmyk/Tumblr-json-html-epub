I mean, she is one of the most avoidant characters on the show, she’s the only gem who’s been seen with a weapon that isn’t a weapon. Pearl has a spear, Amethyst a whip, Garnet gauntlets, and Jasper has a helmet and all of these things are directly linked to both placement of the gem and their own personalities so Lapis really is interesting if you consider her from that angle. Her gem is located on her back, in a place she cannot reach or even see, as opposed to the other gems, who are able to touch their gems for the purpose of directly summoning their weapons. And while the others have weapons, Lapis only has wings, wings made of water that she herself hasn’t made. <\/p>\n\n<p>So Lapis, unlike the other gems, doesn’t have the power to draw on her own power, and instead must rely on a proxy. And Lapis, unlike the other gems, has complete and total power over this proxy she draws upon, and is able to use water in ways that are far more versatile than just weaponizing it. And Earth, a unique planet that the homeland has set their sight upon, is made of seventy percent water. So we have a gem with incredibly odd powers, that are at odds even with the oddities of gem society that we’ve seen, that would in all likelihood make her useless on any planet without an immediate supply of water, being placed on a planet where over seventy percent of the surface is made out of something she has complete and total mastery over. In the initial invasion she would have been invaluable, in the attempted colonization of Earth she would have been even more useful, and when the civil war broke out and Earth was a battlefield rather than a factory, she would have been the most valuable weapon they had. <\/p>\n\n<p>Lapis said to Steven ‘I never believed in this place’. I don’t think she ever cared about Earth. I don’t think Lapis came to Earth believing in the cause she was sent their for, I don’t think she volunteered, I don’t even think she cared about her people, or her government, I think she was sent their for her unique powers, drafted into a war where her only concern was ‘if I do what they want they’ll let me go home’ and instead ended up broken and imprisoned for thousands of years by an enemy she never even cared about defeating. <\/p>\n\n<p>Lapis entire motivation for leading Jasper back to earth was ‘it will be easier if I obey’ and nothing about her suggests that this line of thinking is a new thing for her. I’ve seen a lot of people say that Lapis trapping Jasper beneath the sea was a stupid choice, but I think that defying Jasper, that deciding she will not go along with the wishes of someone else and hope it all ends up okay, was the first choice Lapis has ever truly made.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/tmblr.co\/moZxMZHsv7cfw85Llk6EvFg\">patronissimo<\/a><div> I typed up this huge response to this post earlier but tumblr fuckin ate so basically to summarize my opinion of Lapis wrt self image is that I don’t think Jasper was the first person who abused Lapis Lazuli but she was the first abuser Lapis fought back against. I think I’ve talked to you before about how I think of Lapis as someone who is accustomed to being abused, but I think that Lapis is at the stage where she’s realized that being abused isn’t normal and being abused isn’t something she can live with but she’s not yet at the stage where she is able or willing to realize that her own idea that she is weak and worthless and cannot he saved isn’t something that is hers, it’s something that was branded on her so many times she started believing it was true. \n\nBasically I think she’s spent so long being treated like an object that she cannot really conceptualize herself as a person.<\/div><\/blockquote>",
