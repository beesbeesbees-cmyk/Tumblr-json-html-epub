I’ve never played D&amp;D before - a blemish on my otherwise spotless nerd credentials - but I have done a fair few other RPGs. The rest of my group on the other hand consisted of friends who had not played even one session of a tabletop RPG before. It was a fun session, 5e really is a lightweight system and really noob friendly.<br\/><br\/>But that’s not the point of this post.<br\/><br\/>This post I want to talk about character motivations, specifically villains (or more precisely antagonists).<br\/><br\/>I have traditionally been a bit skeptical about Dungeons and Dragons and I think half of that is due to the archetypal villains. Now what I’m about to say next is entirely my own opinions and preferences - they might well differ from others and that’s fine. In fact that’s one of the great things about tabletop RPGs - they can be tailored by the GM to fit the group! Your preferences for play, style, narrative, storytelling. So these are just my idle thoughts.<\/p><p>D&amp;D, or at least the default setting, has a fairly clear delineation of ‘<b>Good<\/b>’ and ‘<b>Evil<\/b>’ - it’s baked into character creation. However that creates the tendency to have very clear cut villains, plot and narratives. “Stop the bad thing - it’s bad”.<br\/><br\/>Now of course this doesn’t necessarily need to be the case and tastes vary; personally I’m generally more interested in RPGs as an exploration of ‘self’. My villains tend to be more <i>narrative <\/i>focused rather than <i>mechanically <\/i>focused. They are written to fulfill themselves primarily rather than as a mechanism for the characters.<br\/><br\/>Which brings me to the first ‘villain’ my new players faced in the session I ran with them.<br\/><br\/>He was a halfling widower who had lost his two kids two weeks prior to a pox. He had been sold a spell he was told would bring them back but which had instead turned them into zombies and he had been keeping them in the basement because he cannot bring himself to let them go again.<br\/><br\/>He was not evil. In fact he was a fairly nice guy just trying to keep himself together in pretty trying circumstances. But his actions caused the events which ended up being a central theme of the game - and due to the actions of the player characters he actually ended up actively opposing them when they assaulted him after learning of the zombies in his basement.<br\/><br\/>His character was designed specifically to be easy to empathise with, he is the accidental villain - he never meant for any of this. So let’s look at his actions:<br\/><br\/><b>Creating zombies<\/b>: Typically an ‘evil’ act, but he was unaware of his actions. This is fun a action to have because it bring to question of can people be held accountable for the unforeseeable results of their actions? It might be a fairly one-sided debated for most of us but it’s important to note that it still a ’grey-area’.<\/p><p><b>Keeping zombies<\/b>: Also typically ‘evil’. They are dangerous, they can (and actually did) escape and will kill and nothing else. This is a normally a very evil action - however he did it out of love. He couldn’t bring himself to kill them and couldn’t let them go. This is a great character point because it shows us how an ‘evil’ action can be committed by inaction. Again another grey area - can an act of inaction be evil?<br\/><br\/>And throughout the poor guy’s <b>motive <\/b>was a pure one - <b>love<\/b>. In stark contrast to the result of his actions - necromancy. This allows you to explore the darker aspects of typically ‘pure’ and ‘good’ emotions and motivations.<br\/><br\/>You see how these decisions and motives can cause an exploration of people’s own morality? How they view things, test their preconceptions on constructed scenarios? This is why I love complex villains and ‘human’ characters (apologies to the fantasy species) rather than villains that are merely ‘evil’ and lack the same depth.<br\/><br\/>They hit you at a more raw emotional level and make you test yourself against them - and when you have a player actively comparing themself against one of your characters you have successfully created immersion.<br\/><br\/>That’s what I love about RPGs.<\/p><\/blockquote>",
