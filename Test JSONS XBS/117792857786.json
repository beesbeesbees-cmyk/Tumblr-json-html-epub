AKA he was some what like Kankri but probably not exactly lengthy, but spoke a lot about death and such, possibly similar to Aradia. And not to mention his “Great Act” which-<br\/>again reminds me of Aradia since she did have to die before the game as a sacrifice that she claimed \/needed\/ to happen. But its also similar to Sollux’s “sacrifice” for when he took on Eridan in the duel, which then in turn got him knocked out but bought them some time, and it was in an attempt to stop Eridan from fraternizing with the enemy, who then would have most likely killed him on the spot if Eridan didnt have his guard up.–<br\/>so–<br\/>yeah–<br\/>I’ll leave you to discuss that-\n\n<br\/><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I think you forget a lot about Sollux’s own arc. In the beginning of Sgrub, he too spoke of death and all of the things he prophesied. It was getting really annoying for a good number of his friends by the time we meet him for the first time in-comic. Hell, the first log that we see featuring him as him telling Kanaya that he TOLD them that they were all going to die, but nobody listened. <\/p><p>Sollux’s sacrifice wasn’t fighting eridan off, it was blowing up his whole damn brain in order to get the meteor flung into space at the right speed. He died by overexhausting his powers, just like another captor we both know and love. <\/p><p>Kankri doesn’t really ‘warn’ or ‘help’ people. He’s shit enough at defending them as it is. The dude’s just a rambly fake-ass white knight who’s obsessed with the nitty-gritty and likes to spend his time passively insulting people under the guise of defending them. <\/p><p>Aradia certainly spoke about ghosts, and listening to her voices, but she never really went on about death until she became alive again. And even then, it was on a more positive note than anything.<\/p><\/blockquote>",
