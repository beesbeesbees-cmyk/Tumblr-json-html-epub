up mushrooms<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Some of my favorites:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/jayisgames.com\/archives\/2008\/01\/cursor10.php\">Cursor*10 <\/a> - little game where you have several “lives”. you use your cursor to navigate the floors, and when the time runs out, you go back to the beginning. however, the previous cursors will go through the same path they made before, thus allowing you to get further each time.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/jayisgames.com\/archives\/2007\/07\/daymare_town.php\">Daymare Town<\/a> - creepy point and click game. very inky, interesting drawings. you have to find your way through (or perhaps out of) Daymare Town, which is inhabited by obscure prickly people.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/jayisgames.com\/archives\/2005\/02\/gridgame.php\">Grid Game<\/a> - there are a bunch of little circles. click one, and watch it rotate and set off a chain reaction. mindless distraction game.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/jayisgames.com\/archives\/2013\/08\/samsara_room.php\">Samsara Room<\/a> - a strange escape game where you’re stuck in one room but pass through different

href=\"http:\/\/jayisgames.com\/archives\/2007\/04\/feed_the_head.php\">Feed the Head<\/a> - more like interactive art than anything. there are several different things to do in this game.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/jayisgames.com\/archives\/2008\/01\/factory_balls.php\">Factory Balls<\/a> - a bit of a puzzle game. you have to paint a bunch of balls to match the model shown, using various options and paints. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/jayisgames.com\/archives\/2008\/02\/grow_nano_vol_3.php\">Grow Nano Vol. 3<\/a> - one of my favorites of the Grow series. you have to click the options in the right order in order to make the sick person feel better. this one just warms my heart.<\/p>\n<p>make sure to click the tags to find more games by the creators and companies and the rest of the games in the series!!!<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>I find <a href=\"http:\/\/tonypa.pri.ee\/start.html\">Tonypa’s games<\/a> to be simple, unique, and enjoyable.  A lot of them involve patterns, colors, and matching, so they’re very calming as well.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>some from me!!<\/p>\n<p>deep thinking games with exploration themes…<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.crazymonkeygames.com\/6-Differences.html\">6 differences<\/a> - a pretty cool find the difference game that’s very atmospheric and somewhat soothing in the first levels, mostly takes place at night around a city, features sound effects and music and even moving cars down the highways. content warning for some surrealism and acid-trippy effects in the later levels (a person with a deer head, some kind of alarming music, the level’s walls moving as you look for the differences, etc - sometimes the level changes after you find all but one clue, and in one instance a train goes by rather suddenly and loudly, but it didn’t make me jump and i am sensitive to jump scares)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/dai5ychain.net\/breath\/\">i can hold my breath forever<\/a> - a game about exploring underwater caves in search of a friend. some references to drowning!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.newgrounds.com\/portal\/view\/461959\">i wish i were the moon<\/a> - short and sweet game about two people and a moon! clone things and move them around to get different endings :3<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/jayisgames.com\/games\/small-worlds\/\">small words<\/a> - a soothing platformed-style exploration game that lets you uncover different maps\/pictures as you walk around<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/gambolio.com\/#\/game-play:15977\/\">don’t look back<\/a> - a creepy game based on the myth of orpheus and eurydice, this is a platformer-style game that has you going to the underworld to get your lover back. very atmospheric, but a slightly creepy atmosphere that (of course) references death, so take care<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/jayisgames.com\/games\/alight-in-dreams\/\">alight in dreams<\/a> - during a dream you get wings, and explore the dream to find out about the history of a person who has never dreamed before. mentions death and suicide.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.kongregate.com\/games\/racter\/a-house-in-california\">a house in california<\/a> - explore an old house and learn its history, very atmospheric. can be a bit confusing for some, you may need a walkthrough.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.kongregate.com\/games\/GregoryWeir\/silent-conversation\">silent conversation<\/a> - a soothing game that makes levels out of passages of classic books; you win by toughing every word. not my preferred reading material, but the way the levels are built kind of force you to drink it all in stead of speeding through it. <\/p>\n<p>games that are a bit creepy…<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/armorgames.com\/play\/10843\/prior\">prior<\/a> - you, a little box creature, wake without your memories in an unknown place. you must explore to find your family and figure out what happened before you woke. a dark game with multiple possibilities - can be a little creepy.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/pgstudios.org\/games.php?g=2\">immorTall<\/a> - an alien makes friends with a human family after crashlanding to earth. defend them as long as possible!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.alexanderocias.com\/loved.php\">loved<\/a> - a dark sort of game where you go through the levels deciding if you will choose to obey the voice giving you orders or defy it. in some casing obeying makes things easier, but in other cases the voice asks you to make things hard on yourself - throwing yourself onto spikes so you have to start over, etc. sometimes it is almost impossible to do what the voice asks. (serious warning for emotional manipulation, just to be safe - the question at the start will purposefully misgender you depending on your answer, and continue to do so throughout the game, but, depending on your actions, will then correct the mistake at the end.)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.newgrounds.com\/portal\/view\/555181\">one chance<\/a> - a kind of dark game; in the impending apocalypse you have one chance to decide what to do with the rest of your life. there are many endings, but you really do only have one chance…refreshing the page will not let you play again! content warning for death,suicide, impending doom, hopelessness, etc<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/armorgames.com\/play\/6244\/every-day-the-same-dream\">every day the same dream<\/a> - another fatalistic game with multiple endings, but this one allows you to find them all. same warnings as the one above.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/gambit.mit.edu\/loadgame\/summer2010\/elude_play.php\">elude<\/a> - a metaphorical representation of depression. dark melancholy levels, nice atmosphere, but can be a little moody.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/gambit.mit.edu\/loadgame\/summer2010\/symon_play.php\">symon<\/a> - you play as an elderly man stuck in a hospital bed. you sleep to dream and relive your past. this game is pretty much endless and features endless combinations of the same tasks, to reflect what that sort of life might be like. cw for death and end-life blues.<\/p>\n<p>now for some lighter ones…<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.arcadebomb.com\/play\/pizza_king_2.html\">pizza king 2<\/a> - i found this sim where you run your own pizza shop weirdly addictive. food cw, of course, and it’s the only sim on here because they usually aren’t my thing, but, well.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.k2xl.com\/games\/boomshine\/\">boomshine<\/a> &amp; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.k2xl.com\/games\/obechi\/\">obechi<\/a> - two colorful games where a well-placed click will start a chain reaction and see how many points you can collect!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.kongregate.com\/games\/SimianLogic\/filler\">filler<\/a> - a similar concept to the ones above<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.kongregate.com\/games\/rowlandrose\/music-bounce\">music bounce<\/a> - release bouncing balls to hit platforms to get the perfect rhythm!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.kongregate.com\/games\/nick1972uk\/dropsum-v2\">dropsum<\/a> &amp; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kongregate.com\/games\/nick1972uk\/dropsum-colours\">dropsum colors<\/a> - math games where you combine numbers to eliminate them. you can choose where to drop the numbers, turn the board, and use powerups! (dropsum colors isn’tloading for me rn, but it might for you)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.firstpersontetris.com\/\">first person tetris<\/a> - you spin with the tetris blocks! fun for pros, but it can make you dizzy.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.fltron.com\/\">flash tron<\/a> - a recreation of the original tron game as seen in the movies. here you can play with others online!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.funland.com\/dolphin-olympics-2.html\">dolphin olympics<\/a> - super fun game where you swim and do tricks as a dolphin to score as many points as you can in two minutes. there’s also a freeplay mode. if you jump high enough, you may even see the moon ouo<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ea.com\/1\/mirrors-edge-2d\">mirror’s edge 2d<\/a> - i adore the 3d version of this game for ps3, but if you don’t have access, you can play the mini\/2d version. no real story, but it’s a very challenging game with rad animation!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.playtowerdefensegames.com\/games\/1264\/play.html\">bubble tanks tower defense<\/a> - pretty fun tower defense game that doesn’t get old too quickly.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/ninjakiwi.com\/all-games\">bloons<\/a> - i started playing the tower defense game, but they’re all pretty fun and complex. scroll down a bit and click any of the ones under “bloons games”<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/armorgames.com\/category\/elephant-games\">elephant games<\/a> - a sort-of series with gems like “achievement unlocked” &amp; sequels (where there is no objective except to complete all the achievements) and “this is the only level” (where you go through the same level many different ways). you grow to be quite fond of the little guy. :’D<\/p>\n<p>some of these i haven’t played in awhile! i pulled from my bookmarks, because i used to spend all day curating links to these things. if i’ve missed a content warning PLEASE feel free to contact me about it or add it yourself!<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>",
