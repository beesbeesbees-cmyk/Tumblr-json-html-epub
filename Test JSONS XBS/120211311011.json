Other fruit juices too, but I tend to have best results with oj or cider. Pour some into an empty ice-cube tray, let them freeze, and the result is slightly-flaky frozen goodness. This is also an easy way to make homemade popsicles–put a sheet of aluminum foil over top of the tray and stick toothpick\/popsicle sticks in so the juice freezes around them.<br\/><\/li><li>Grapes were mentioned. Grapes are TRUE.<\/li><li>NOT SODAS. Do not freeze sodas! They explode.<br\/><\/li><li>Strawberries! These can be hard to find cheap, especially outside of strawberry season, and I don’t know about their availability outside of my part of the US, but if you can get them they’re great frozen in your water. Freeze-dry strawberries by laying them out on a tray or sth in the freezer, and then when they’re frozen just put them in a bag to conserve space.<\/li><\/ul><p>Other general tips:<br\/><\/p><ul><li>Fruit in water is amazing when you’re someone like me who doesn’t like water’s lack of taste. Strawberries and mint leaves are fairly traditional, but basically anything you like will work. there are lots of combos online.<br\/><\/li><li>If you have a blender or a food processor, smoothies are a good way to eat something when you’re too hot to function. Fruit+ice+milk+yogurt is pretty traditional.<\/li><li>Have sunscreen. Make sure you don’t have any skin reactions to the sunscreen. If your sunscreen has fragrance, make sure you can deal with the fragrance when it’s constantly on your face in heat.<\/li><li>Speaking off: sunscreen is not just for arms\/shoulders. Put sunscreen on your face, especially nose\/cheekbones\/forehead. Put sunscreen on the tops of your ears! If your hair has a tight part, try to put sunscreen there if you don’t wear a hat (scalp burns are PAINFUL). Put sunscreen on your legs, especially the backs of your calves. Put sunscreen on any visible parts of your feet.<br\/><\/li><li>Wear loose clothing if you can, especially if you’re wearing long sleeves. Any constrictions on your breathing feel much worse in the heat.<br\/><\/li><\/ul><\/blockquote>\n\n<p>If you need to cool down quick, run cold water over your wrists (or put ice cubes on them maybe?). This is a trick they taught us in gymnastics class but it works just as well on hot days.<\/p><p>When you start getting that feeling like you’ve adapted to the heat, like it’s not bad, like you could just stay where you are for hours and hours, even get a blanket, and maybe you feel like you’re zoning out a little, it’s time to <i>reconsider, move around, have something cool to drink<\/i>.<\/p><p>And it can be hard to remember to eat when it’s so hot, for some reason. Cold food in small portions is generally easiest to manage. But remember to eat food with a lot of salt, a lot of potassium, a lot of vitamins. I can’t believe bananas aren’t on this post. My god, get your potassium, you’ll feel SO much better. If you’re eating something salty and it tastes unusually, amazingly good, it’s because you’re running low on salt, so keep eating it.<\/p><p>and seriously yeah keep an eye on people like kids and the elderly and anyone who’s under your care. ask them how they’re feeling if they’re able to tell you, and if not, try to see if they’re looking unusually unfocused, breathing too hard, haven’t had anything to drink in a while, etc.<\/p><p>If you bind, be even more careful about how long you bind and pay even more attention to your binder’s effects on your body.<\/p><p>sometimes there’s nothing else for it but to just fill a bathtub with cool water and get in. Seriously, it can be so helpful. Also, showers. Showers are good.<\/p><p>also take care of your dogs I don’t know anything about dogs but be careful for them! maybe look up some tips.<br\/><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n<p>also could anyone who even thinks about reblogging this from me to make fun of brits, pls stop?? when it gets hot here it’s kind of awful bc A\/C is rare and they’re really not used to this kind of heat. if you add any sort of teasing if u reblog this for me i will find u and push you<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Clothes! <br\/>Cotton, linen, sports clothes all breath well. Anything wool or animal fiber has scales on the fibers that trap air that make insulating heat pockets. Even if it’s thin, for the love of god stay away from wool. Woven sundresses, athletic wear designed to wick water away from the skin. <br\/>Wear sandals cause socks (which I advise against cause women loose a lot of heat through their feet (that’s why women’s sleeping bags often have feet zippers at the bottom in case you overheat)) and socks keep in heat seriously sandals are so good like you don’t have to lace anything up and when you’re feet are out and about in the air all day they don’t stink up. <br\/>If you’re sending kids off to summer camp pack their lunches in insulated lunch boxes cause they could sit on the blacktop in the hot sun all day and then your possibly overheated kid has to eat an overheated lunch. Also talk to the counsellors at camp and ask about how often they take water breaks. Like as a camp counselor I can tell you honestly the counselors will be happy to answer your questions as long as you’re not rude or overly worried. Send them to camp with sunscreen on already but also tell them to put more on whenever the counselors ask. (You have no idea how annoying the kids who think they don’t need to re-apply are)<br\/>In general. Be careful. Have a good summer. Drive on the right side of the road damnit<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Headstroke and Dehydration will make a person nauseated, disoriented, lightheaded, dizzy, cause muscle cramps and weakness. <\/p><p>The main difference is that JUST Dehydration will make someone look very pale and clammy, often with purple lips. They might look a bit peaky beforehand, but their face will suddenly drain of color, and they’ll probably start listing to the side, speaking very quietly and staring at the ground or at their hands.<\/p><p> This is because they’re probably feeling the ‘swimming’ effect like when you’re tipsy drunk and the world starts to tilt around you.<br\/><\/p><p>Meanwhile Heatstroke (which is usually brought on by high temps + dehydration) will make a person’s cheeks flush brightly, and cause them to pant, and their heart race. They’re basically overheating like a computer, and out of control temperatures CAN damage internal organs - like your brain. Just like a high fever can be very dangerous, Heatstroke is the same danger. <\/p><p>If you see someone either ‘Panting and red’ or ‘quiet and pale’ when they weren’t earlier, CHECK THEIR HEALTH. <\/p><p>My brother gets easily dehydrated, and doesn’t like to speak up about any discomfort, so I’ve had him faint around me a couple times. I’ve gotten better at spotting the symptoms. <\/p><p>1) <b>Face <\/b>- Is it pale, is it bright red? Do they look clammy?   My brother’s pupils dilate a lot when he’s dehydrated, but idk if that’s standard. \n\n<\/p><p>2)<b> Awareness<\/b> - Can they look up and around alertly, or are they trying to focus on a solid object and\/or moving slowly? Have they been shuffling more than they were earlier? <\/p><p>3)<b> Strength <\/b>- Can they grab your hand with a good amount of strength? Muscle weakness really only sets in during the late stages of dehydration, so you’ll likely see them first staggering to walk, but it’s good to check. <\/p><p>4)<b>Treatment <\/b>- SIT THEIR ASS DOWN IN SOME SHADE. Get them to drink small sips of warm or room-temperature <b>water<\/b>. Ice water sounds good, but it’ll just make them puke and make things worse. Drinking in huge gulps will also make them vomit.  If you can get your hands on some ice, apply to chest, throat, armpit and back. If no ice, dump some water on them and fan them with something. <\/p><p>Make sure they STAY SEATED until the wooziness goes away, and their color returns to normal. If it got bad enough for them to faint, it might take up to a half hour for things to return to normal, if they’ve got shade, water, and a source of cooling off. <\/p><p>If they’re still showing signs of severe weakness and disorientation after a half-hour of treatment, CALL A FUKKIN DOCTOR. They’ll probably just stick a saline bag in, to hydrate them intravenously, but slumping and wooziness could also be a sign that they were internally damaged by the heat. <\/p><p>People who are primarily indoors, or who don’t exercise much are INCREDIBLY at-risk for becoming dehydrated. They’re used to be in a controlled environment, and don’t have to drink much to stay reasonably hydrated. The outside heat + walking around in that heat will shove their body into the ‘danger’ zone way faster than someone who is used to working hard in the heat. <\/p><p>People drinking alcohol are also at-risk, since alcohol quickly dehydrates the body and brain. <\/p><p>Dehydration + Heat = Heat Stroke. <\/p><p>Don’t let your Heat Stroke become a Death Stroke. <\/p><p><b>Drink water. <\/b><\/p><figure data-orig-width=\"470\" data-orig-height=\"480\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/64.media.tumblr.com\/3db39c5eb3d28579503a9130120d5493\/tumblr_inline_norsf6jRo31qdczye_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"470\" data-orig-height=\"480\"\/><\/figure><\/blockquote>",
