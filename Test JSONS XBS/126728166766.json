  "regular-body": "<p><a class=\"tumblr_blog\" href=\"http:\/\/chocolatekimmi.tumblr.com\/post\/125285979571\">chocolatekimmi<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So one of the coolest, most intriguing parts of Steven Universe to me is the concept of fusion. I am a huge frickin nerd and I will spend hours just sitting here trying to comprehend what it must be like to experience being a fusion. <\/p>\n<p>For a long time though, there have been certain things that have had me stumped:<\/p>\n<p>1) How could Pearl hide her intentions from Rose and Garnet during their respective fusions?<\/p>\n<p>2) How could Jasper not realized Lapis was going to trap her while there were fused as Malachite?<\/p>\n<p>3) Why was Alexandrite so quiet and (imo) uninteresting during fusion cuisine, despite being a fusion of so many gems? <\/p>\n<p>Before, I was under the assumption that when gems were in sync during a fusion, their minds “melded” and became one. However, the above scenarios wouldn’t make sense if that were the case. <\/p>\n<p>But then I realized, we’ve been <b>blatantly told how fusion works<\/b>. And during one of the most memorable episodes at that. <\/p>\n<figure data-orig-width=\"683\" data-orig-height=\"384\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/64.media.tumblr.com\/e70e9e52409586b890d99d4d879e66dd\/tumblr_inline_ns7s7qBwmU1sb2glm_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"683\" data-orig-height=\"384\"\/><\/figure><p><b>“I am their conversation.” <\/b>What if we take this statement as literally as possible? <br\/><\/p>\n<p>How about this: When gems are fused, each gem in the fusion is <b>actually having a conversation with each other<\/b>. In order to stay fused, the gems have to communicate, agree, compromise, debate and plan together. When this is done perfectly, their voices “sync up”, and the fusion’s amalgam personality arises. <\/p>\n<p>At the same time, whenever gems within a fusion have a difficult time communicating, <b>the fusion’s personality dissolves and each gem speaks separately<\/b> through the fusion’s mouth. <\/p>\n<figure data-orig-width=\"684\" data-orig-height=\"384\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/64.media.tumblr.com\/7a312a82e34bdd83dc75d441778e68b6\/tumblr_inline_ns7tg0JO3r1sb2glm_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"684\" data-orig-height=\"384\"\/><\/figure><p>The concept of fusion as conversation also perfectly explains how Pearl could hide information all the time during fusions, as well as how Lapis could fool Jasper while becoming Malachite. <b>Because a fusion can only know what each gem discloses<\/b>.<\/p>\n<p>THIS ALSO MAKES ALEXANDRITE FRICKIN HILARIOUS. She wasn’t quiet and to herself because she lacked personality. She barely talked because Ruby, Sapphire, Amethyst, and Pearl were <b>so awkward and had no idea what to say or do<\/b>. But she had a stoic face because they all agreed they had to play it cool.<\/p>\n<p>Viewing fusions as conversations just changed so much for me about this show, there’s a lot of little things I’ve noticed that I don’t want to get into cause this is already really long. Overall, it’s deepened my appreciate of the fact that fusions are metaphors for relationships. Remember what Garnet said to Stevonnie:<\/p>\n<figure data-orig-width=\"683\" data-orig-height=\"384\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/64.media.tumblr.com\/f3d21af413c3ed802751f9d029a09e93\/tumblr_inline_ns7uo1y9hL1sb2glm_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"683\" data-orig-height=\"384\"\/><\/figure><p><b>“You are not two people. You are not one person. You are an experience.”<\/b><br\/><\/p>\n<p>Because relationships aren’t about changing, or gaining, or becoming something new. Relationships aren’t about who you are as individuals or as a group. <b>Relationships are what is created between people. They’re the result of conversation and contribution and compromise. They are an experience.<\/b><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>",
