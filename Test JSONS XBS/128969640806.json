Kids are so interesting\nbecause they’re mirrors, they don’t over think things like adults do and Alex\nhas written Mabel and Dipper exactly how twelve year olds are; some want to\ngrow up, others are just enjoying the moment.<\/p>\n<p>Mabel and Dipper are the most fascinating\ncharacters I’ve ever seen, particularly in character development but, for right\nnow, I’m focusing on Mabel.<\/p>\n<p>Where <i>has<\/i>\nMabel’s goodness gone? Is she truly growing to become morally ambiguous?<\/p>\n<p>Yes, she is becoming more morally\nambiguous. Of <i>course<\/i> she is. Everyone\non this site is older than Mabel (if you follow the ‘must be over the age of thirteen’\nrule), that means that we have <i>all<\/i>\nbeen through more lessons, more experiences, more <i>everything<\/i> than she has. <\/p>\n<p>She’s twelve.<\/p>\n<p><i>Twelve<\/i>. <\/p>\n<p>You know what I did when I was twelve? I\nbroke about six windows, lit my backyard on fire, and did a whole bunch of\nstuff that would probably get me in huge trouble (and land me in prison) now\nthat I’m an adult including trespassing, graffiti, and damage to private\nproperty. <\/p>\n<p>Mabel is a pretty tame child compared to\nthe hellion that I was. But here’s the massive difference between being twelve\nand being an adult; you know when things are wrong. When I broke those six\nwindows I wasn’t <i>trying<\/i> to break\nthem. I was simply trapped inside and my siblings thought it would be fun to\nplay hockey\/football\/cricket\/baseball and other such games in our basement.<\/p>\n<p>Does that make me a horrible person for\nbreaking the window on accident? I should hope not.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, our parents <i>started<\/i> the hockey in the basement. My mother and father played it <i>with<\/i> us. So if <i>they<\/i> did it, why couldn’t we?<\/p>\n<p>Now, let’s look at Mabel. Mabel and Dipper\nget the tie in “The Stanchurian Candidate” from Ford and Dipper shows an <i>amazing<\/i> amount of maturity when he says:\n“This is amazing! And ethically ambiguous!”<\/p>\n<p>At that moment he’s questioning whether or\nnot they should actually use the tie. Dipper sees a problem with it, turns to\nan adult (who he really looks up to) and asks ‘is this okay?’ and the adult\n(Stanford Pines) <i>gives him the other tie<\/i>\nand says “use it responsibly”. <\/p>\n<p>Dipper is twelve. <\/p>\n<p>Dipper has a faint idea that mind control\nis <i>bad<\/i> but his hero, his Grunkle,\njust gave him a tie that <i>said Grunkle<\/i>\ndesigned and said ‘go for it’.<\/p>\n<p>How is this any different than when I broke\nsix windows?<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, Dipper runs upstairs, hands the\ntie to Mabel and she controls Soos. We, as the audience, know that this is a <i>very very bad thing<\/i>. Mabel and Dipper?\nThey <i>don’t<\/i>. Someone said they can do\nit. An adult gave them permission. <i>That <\/i>is\nwhy Mabel doesn’t bring it up in front of the unicorn. Grunkle Ford gave them\nthe supplies and permission to control people’s minds so <i>of course<\/i> they’re not going to see anything wrong with it. <\/p>\n<p>Even when Gideon says “you two have gotten\nmuch eviller since I last saw [you]” they don’t fully comprehend it. Stanford <i>said<\/i> they could do it so it can’t be\nbad, right? A tear is going to come between them at this. Someone is going to\nrealize that, no, the adults are not always right and we see that seed planted\nin “The Last Mabelcorn” when Mabel finds out that Stanford is <i>wrong<\/i> about the unicorns, but I’ll get\nto that some other time and on some other post.<\/p>\n<p>Now, knowing that Mabel and Dipper don’t\nsee what they’ve done as truly bad in “The Stanchurian Candidate”, “The Last\nMabelcorn” is interesting. Mabel is told that she’s not a good person by a\ncreature she has deeply admired from childhood and, instead of giving up, she\ntries to make herself better.<\/p>\n<p>She does <i>one thousand good deeds<\/i> okay. <i>One\nthousand<\/i>. This child is freaking dedicated to being a good person. And she’s\n<i>worried<\/i> about it. Mabel is <i>terrified<\/i> of not being good (“if I’m not\na good person, then who am I?”). That’s a pretty nice sign of a good person; if\nyou wonder if you’re doing bad or if you’re evil, chances are that you’re\nprobably not. <\/p>\n<p>And the unicorn tells her that doing good\ndeeds to make herself look better is bad. First of all, that was rude as fuck,\nsecond of all, how are people supposed to be <i>good<\/i> then? Mabel does one thousand good deeds. The unicorn sits in\nfront of a flipping rainbow at three o’clock and poses. <\/p>\n<p>That’s not the finishing move, though.\nMabel does do the thousand good deeds to make herself better, but she’s\nconscience of it. You know how she’s a good person? Wendy, Grenda, and Candy\nknock out queen bitch of the unicorns, are about to steal her hair <i>and what does Mabel do?<\/i><\/p>\n<p>She stops them. <\/p>\n<p>Because it’s <i>wrong<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p><i>That<\/i> is what makes Mabel a good person. Not the one thousand good deeds,\nnot her glitter filled blood stream. When Mabel knows something is wrong, she\nputs a stop to it. She just needs to learn what is wrong, just like the rest of\nus. We’re not born with a conscience radar in our brains; we learn from the\npeople around us.<\/p>\n<p>She is <i>twelve<\/i>.\nShe’s still learning all of this. But from what she <i>knows<\/i>; Mabel is a good person. She’s kind and nice and gives people\nsecond chances even when people (*cough* Dipper *cough*) don’t believe said\nperson deserves it. <\/p>\n<p>Where has Mabel’s goodness gone, then?<\/p>\n<p>Nowhere. It’s just hidden behind things\nthat she <i>believes<\/i> is okay because people\n<i>told<\/i> her it was.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>ALL OF YOU. EVERY SINGLE DAMN ONE OF YOU. NEEDS TO STOP WHAT YOU’RE DOING AND READ THIS. THEN READ IT AGAIN. THEN TAKE A FEW HOURS TO DIGEST IT AND READ IT AGAIN. MEMORIZE IT.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>",
