You know: in the movie, \nwhen Lefou runs in trying to catch the duck\/goose that Gaston has just \nshot out of the sky?<\/p>\n<p>Originally, the actors were going to stroll \non stage with our Lefou hauling in the really neat (and real!) \ntaxidermied deer head that we had found in a local thrift store. Now, \ntwo days before opening night, our director wants Lefou to run in from \noff stage and catch a stuffed duck that Gaston has just shot. This, of \ncourse, requires two things to work properly as a scene: a gunshot \nnoise, and a stuffed duck.<\/p>\n<p>The gunshot noise, we had covered. \nBlue-collar, redneck school? Guns a plenty to record. The stuffed duck? \nHarder than you might have thought to obtain.<\/p>\n<p>Three hunting \nstores, two taxidermists, and one Pet Supply Store ™, I’d finally found a\n semi-realistic pheasant squeaky toy. What follows is an account of the \nways this dog toy managed to be the nightmare prop of the six show run.<\/p>\n<p>Opening\n Night: The stagehand, who was supposed to drop the bird from the \nceiling catwalk, missed his cue and didn’t drop the it. Lefou’s actor \nrolls with it and does an excellent job of looking around foolishly \nbefore getting cuffed upside the head by Gaston. The stagehand then \ndrops the bird squarely on Gaston’s head. Cue laughter.<\/p>\n<p>Saturday \nMatinee: Different stagehand throws the bird instead of dropping it and \nbeans Lefou directly in the face with the prop. Lefou falls over. Cue \nlaughter.<\/p>\n<p>Saturday Night: Bird is missing during curtain call. \nDirector hauls the deer head down from it’s place on the tavern wall and\n tells Gaston and Lefou to revert to the old blocking i.e. no gunshot, \nno bird, just walk in with trophy. During Gaston and Lefou’s \nconversation, gun shot sound goes off and a stagehand throws the bird \nonto the stage…from the wrong side of the stage. Lefou and Gaston stare \nat it in awkward silence for a solid thirty seconds before Lefou makes \noff-script, subtle joke about Gaston’s gun going off late instead of \nearly. Cue adults in the audience laughing.<\/p>\n<p>Sunday Matinee: \nDirector begs the stagehands to get the cue right at least once. Gunshot\n and bird prop go off without a hitch. Lefou accidentally catches the \nprop when it falls from the catwalk. He’s so startled that he caught it \nthat Gaston runs right in to him. They drop both the gun and the bird \nprops, and grab the wrong prop in their scramble. Gaston spends the rest\n of the scene gesturing dramatically with a stuffed pheasant, instead of\n a gun.<\/p>\n<p>Sunday Night: \n\nDirector is fed up with bird prop, decides that Lefou should just carry \nbird prop in after gunshot happens off stage. Lefou accidentally \nsqueezes the prop during the intro conversation, startling both actors \ninto silence with the squeaky toy noise - apparently, neither of them \nrealized it was a dog toy.\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Monday Elementary School Show: Lefou walks on stage with the \nbird. Accidentally drops the prop during conversation with Gaston. \nGaston doesn’t notice the dropped prop and steps on it. Cue depressingly\n sad squeaky toy noise. Cue ten years olds laughing.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>",
